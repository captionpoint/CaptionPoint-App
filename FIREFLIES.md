## OLIVIA:
September 15,

---

1963.

---

Dear Ruby,

---

it's been a while.

---

The sky, it's been burning
so bright since you left.

---

It reminds me of you.
---

[bomb sounds]
---

God,
---

I keep hearing these bombs.
---

When will it stop?
---

[bomb sounds]
---

I can't do this.
---

[crying]
---

[song plays]
---

## SPEAKER: 
Reverend Charles Emmanuel Grace
gave a touching speech
---

while in Birmingham, Alabama.
---

Following the bombing
of the 16th Street Baptist church,
---

which killed four young colored girls
yesterday morning.
---

[background noise]
---

## OLIVIA:
[gasps] Oh,
---

shit.
---

Oh, shit.
---

## CHARLES:
Olivia.

---

## OLIVIA:
Charles.
--

## CHARLES:
Oh, I missed you.
---

## OLIVIA:
I missed you too.
--

## CHARLES:
Come on.
---

Let's cut up, like we used to. [laughs]
---

## OLIVIA:
[chuckles] I have to finish
snapping these beans for supper.
---

## CHARLES:
Oh, them beans can wait, baby.
---

I need them fingers of yours right now.
---

What?
---

## OLIVIA:
Just listening to you talking
how you talking.
---

## CHARLES:
Oh, well, maybe you'll hear
me better if I'm singing what I'm saying.
---
template: song
## CHARLES:
Send me
---
template: song
## CHARLES:
Darling, you send me
---
template: song
## CHARLES:
I know you send me
---
template: song
## CHARLES:
Honest, you do, honest, you do
---
template: song
## CHARLES:
Honest, you do, whoa
---
template: song
## CHARLES:
Ooh, I couldn't wait to hold you.
---

## OLIVIA:
Sweetie, after I finished cooking,
you can hold me all you want.
---

I promise.
---

## CHARLES:
Oh, I missed you so much, Liv.
I'm so happy to be back.
---

You know a man ain't supposed to be
away from his woman that long.
---

## OLIVIA:
You were only gone one day.

---

## CHARLES:
One day or not, it's ungodly.
---

## OLIVIA:
Well, since you
already been sinning,
---

what's a few more minutes going to hurt?
---

## CHARLES:
My heart.
---

Being away from it made me remember
how much I miss your body on mine.
---

How much I need your body on my [hums]
---
template: overlap
## OLIVIA:
[laughs]

## CHARLES:
What?
---

## OLIVIA:
I haven't heard you
talk like this in a while.
---

## CHARLES:
Well, you know how I get
when I'm away from you.
---

## OLIVIA:
I know.
---

## CHARLES:
Being away from you
makes me miss you.
---

## OLIVIA:
Being away from me puts you
in rare form.
---

## CHARLES:
I am in the form of a man,
---

who has been missing his woman.
---

## OLIVIA:
I'm almost done.
--

## CHARLES:
Come on, Liv. I need you now.
---

## OLIVIA:
See, done.
---

I'm going to put these green beans
on the stove,
---

and we are going to eat dinner.
---

## CHARLES:
Oh, I'm going to eat
more than dinner tonight.
---

## OLIVIA:
[laughs]
We are going to eat dinner,
---

and you are going to tell me
all about what happened
---

while you were away, Mr. Fresh.
---

Now, go in the bathroom
and wash your hands.
---

## CHARLES:
Well, the only place
I've been is all over you.
---

## OLIVIA:
Go on and wash your hands,
Charles Emmanuel Grace.
---

## CHARLES:
Ooh, I already got you
screaming my whole name,
---

and I ain't even do nothing yet.
---

## OLIVIA:
Boy, get--
---

## CHARLES:
[barks] [laughs]
---

God, it is smelling like you
everywhere I go.
---

How you do that?
---

## OLIVIA:
Magic.
---

## CHARLES:
Hey, what you making?
---

## OLIVIA:
Some turkey wings and rice,
---

green beans, and some rolls.
---

## CHARLES:
Oh, you know the way to my heart.
--

## OLIVIA:
[chuckles] And stomach, it seems.
---

## CHARLES: 
All I had on that trip was crackers.

## OLIVIA: 
Crackers, Charles?
---

## CHARLES:
Yes, we was moving around
so much I forgot to eat. [chuckles]
---

## OLIVIA:
Hell, you have to stop
doing that, honey.
---

## CHARLES:
I know, it's just--
---

It's hard, Liv.
---

I'm on them trips,
not thinking about food.
---

My mind is too busy entertaining death.
---

It's always there.
Some way of lurking.
---

It seem like death is always greeting
the colored person at they front door.
---

It don't matter if we change our address,
---

or put up a sign that flat out say,
"Death, you ain't welcome here."
---

Seem like we ain't got no choice,
but to let it in.
---

## OLIVIA:
We have a choice.
--

## CHARLES:
Do we?
---

It's greeting us at church now,
a place of worship.
---

Them four little girls
woke up yesterday morning,
---

put on their prettiest of dresses,
wore the biggest smiles they could find,
---

thinking they were going to praise
the Lord.
---

I bet it ain't cross their mind that that
would be the day that they'd meet Him.
---

Well, I never thought White people
would get so low as to bomb churches.
---

## OLIVIA:
That's why
we have to keep on flying.
---

We have to make our way to that place,
---

where if death does come knocking
on our door,
---

we'll have the strength to fight it off.
---

To tell it, "Death, you have no business
on our front porch."
---

## CHARLES:
I am getting out of fighting
this fight, Liv.
---

## OLIVIA:
So am I, but I do it.
---

## CHARLES:
You know the bombing was so bad,
---

they couldn't recognize
one of the little girls?
---

Only way they knew who she was,
was the clothes on her back,
---

and the ring on her finger, they say.
---

## OLIVIA:
Lord. Oh, I can't even imagine.
---

## CHARLES:
The mothers,
they had photographs of them.
---

They were the prettiest little girls.
---

## OLIVIA:
That's enough, honey.
---

## CHARLES:
I'm sorry.
---

I'm still caught up in it, I guess.
---

## OLIVIA:
Oh, pain has a way of lingering.
---

## CHARLES:
Yes, it does,
and so does being paranoid.
---

We didn't even stay at the motel.
I couldn't bring myself to.
---

## OLIVIA:
Why is that?
---

## CHARLES:
Well, I kept thinking
about a bomb
---

being planted by some hate-filled person,
---

or a wiretap from the FBI.
---

They seem so incessant
on stopping this movement.
---

They'll do anything to bring us down,
any, oh, incredulous thing.
---

## OLIVIA:
What did you and Calvin say?
---

## CHARLES:
I went to the home
of one of the churches' ushers.
---

## OLIVIA:
Well, thank God
for the church's hospitality.
---

## CHARLES:
You--
[laughs] A guy would've thought,
---

they was housing a celebrity
from how they was acting.
---

## OLIVIA:
[chuckles] I can only imagine.
---

## CHARLES:
Your speech went over well.
--

## OLIVIA:
That's good.
---

## CHARLES:
It gave them comfort,
especially, the mothers.
---

## OLIVIA:
Oh, that is real good.
---

## CHARLES:
It's always a moment
---

where I can literally
feel the people live.
---

I feel that heaviness from this world,
---

and it's in this moment
---

where I feel that burden's made light.
---

This time it happened
at the part of the speech, where I say,
---

"Let us paint the sky crimson
---

with the blood of those
who came before us.
---

Who died for us to be here,
---

as a reminder of why we need
to keep pushing on.
---

A reminder that we must look to the sky,
---

to not only see the sacrifices behind us,
---

but our promises that are lying ahead.
---

As our eyes are lifted toward the sky,
---

our feet are moving
toward a promised land.
---

Our hearts are filled
with the spirit of little Addie Mae Collins,
---

little Carol Denise McNair,
---

little Carole Robertson,
and little Cynthia Wesley.
---

Our hands are reaching
for a better tomorrow
---

that they weren't able to see,
but our eyes are locked on.
---

We no longer need a north star
---

to guide us because God
is showing us a new way,
---

and from how the sky is shining,
---

the light is right
at the tip our fingers,
---

and all we have to do it's grab it."
---

Hey. [laughs]
---

## OLIVIA:
Oh, the fire you preach with,
I know they left that church full.
---

## CHARLES:
Oh, they did.
---

## OLIVIA:
The fire you preach with,
I know you left that church empty.
---

## CHARLES:
I did. [laughs]
---

## OLIVIA:
Let me fill you up, sweetie.
---

## CHARLES:
Oh, come on there.
--

## OLIVIA:
[laughs]
---

## CHARLES:
Oh God.
---

[pause]
---

## CHARLES:
Oh, now this looks good.
--

## OLIVIA:
Thanks.
---

## CHARLES:
Yes, I'm going to tear
this dinner up.
---

Heavenly Father,
---

thank you for allowing me
to make it home in one piece,
---

and with my peace of mind.
---

Thank you for allowing my wife
to see another day.
---

We thank you, Lord, because we know
another day is never promised,
---

especially, for your colored children,
---

your favorite children.
---

That's why we're down here
being treated this way.
---

Folks don't like us being your favorite.
[chuckles]
---

Father, please, hold the mothers
of those four little girls in Alabama,
---

a little tighter tonight.
---

Comfort them
as they rest their weary eyes.
---

Comfort every colored mother
---

so that she knows
she is not loving a tombstone.
---

Comfort Olivia,
as she prepares to bring new life
---

into this world for the very first time.
---

Allow her to know that,
though the world tries to say otherwise,
---

it is okay to raise a colored child.
---

Finally, Father, about us
being your favorites,
---

don't you worry, that's our little secret,
we'll keep it between us. Amen.
---

## OLIVIA:
[laughs]
---

## CHARLES:
How's my baby doing?
---

## OLIVIA:
I'm good.
---

## CHARLES:
And my other baby?
---

[laughs] The doctor says,
---

"You're going to be showing soon
with our little miracle,
---

and soon the whole world is going know
that Olivia Maddie Grace is pregnant."
---

[laughs]
---

## OLIVIA:
It's doing good, Charles.
---

I felt it move this morning?
---

## CHARLES:
Really?
## OLIVIA:
Yes.
---

## CHARLES:
I missed it?
---

## OLIVIA:
You were out doing
what you were supposed to be doing.
---

## CHARLES:
At what cost?
--

## OLIVIA:
The hope of colored folk.
---

For us to be reminded
that we have to keep going.
---

For us to be reminded
why we have to keep going.
---

## CHARLES:
I'm missing the joy here, Liv.
--

## OLIVIA:
I know it feels that way.
---

## CHARLES:
Did you smile
when you felt it move?
---

## OLIVIA:
Yes.
---

## CHARLES:
Listen, if something like that
happens again, can you call me?
---

## OLIVIA:
Yes.
---

## CHARLES:
I mean it, Liv.
If I can't be here to see the moments,
---

I at least want to feel them.
---

## OLIVIA:
I'll call you. I promise.
---

## CHARLES:
Thank you.
---

[laughs] Now, where am I,
---

where am I going to next?
---

## OLIVIA:
Oh, eat your food.
You can work later.
---

## CHARLES:
No, just tell me.
---

Hate don't stop,
ain't no reason for us to.
---

[pause]
---

## OLIVIA:
Next week you're in Charlotte.
---

James Tilbert was arrested there,
so they need you.
---

Of course, tomorrow evening,
you'll have to head back to Birmingham
---

to speak at the little girl's funeral
on Wednesday morning.
---

## CHARLES:
Oh, I can't bring myself
to look at those little caskets, Liv.
---

## OLIVIA:
But the mothers asked for you,
personally.
---

For your words and comfort,
---

and for you to help those little girls
in the last step of their transition.
---

I'll have your speech
ready by tomorrow morning.
---

Don't you worry with these
latest donations that we've gotten.
---

Not only can we afford
your travel and lodging,
---

but will be taken care of
for the next few months.
---

## CHARLES:
Oh, God.
What would I do without you?
---

## OLIVIA:
Probably, eat Turkey wings all day
until you get so fat,
---

they have to roll you to the pulpit.
[laughs]
---

## CHARLES:
I can't find a lie in that.
---

We're going to make good parents, right?
---

## OLIVIA:
I hope so.
---

Last night I had a dream
---

that the sky wasn't on fire anymore.
---

After all this time,
it just wasn't anymore,
---

but it was still so bright.
---

The sky was filled with fireflies
---

being for as far as your eyes could see,
---

there were fireflies.
---

Now, I didn't know what to do.
---

I got so used to seeing fire,
---

that seeing fireflies in the sky
actually scared me, so I start to pray.
---

I ask, "What does it all mean?"
---

I hear Him. I hear God.
---

His voice is real faint,
I was struggling to hear Him, but I do.
---

He says,
---

"Each firefly is one of my colored kids
flying home."
---

That scared me even more,
because there was so many.
---

I much rather have fire,
I'm used to that.
---

I'm used to the bombings
and the crosses burning and all of that.
---

I'm not used to seeing
God's children fly home.
---

## CHARLES:
You are still seeing fire
and hearing bombs in your head?
---

## OLIVIA:
Yes.
---

You know it just comes and goes though?
---

## CHARLES:
I'm going to go outside
on the porch for a minute,
---

but I love you.
---

## OLIVIA:
I love you too.
---

[pause]
---

[Little Richard - Long Tall Sally song plays]
---

## CHARLES:
I want seconds.
---

## OLIVIA:
[chuckles] All right,
let me get your plate.
---

## CHARLES:
Well, I ain't talking about that.
--

## OLIVIA:
Oh, neither am I.
---

[chuckles]
---

[grunting and moaning]
---

## CHARLES:
[chuckles]
---

[pause]
---

## CHARLES:
[chuckles]
---

[silence]
---

Liv, where's the ashtray?
---

## OLIVIA:
What?
--

## CHARLES:
[chuckles] Where is the ashtray?
---

## OLIVIA:
Hold on.
---

Where'd you leave it last?
---

## CHARLES:
You know if I knew that,
I wouldn't be looking for it.
---

[silence]
---

## OLIVIA:
That's where you had it last.
---

## CHARLES:
Really? [laughs]
--

## OLIVIA:
Really.
---

## CHARLES:
Now, why would I leave it there?
--

## OLIVIA:
I don't know.
---

## CHARLES:
[laughs] I hope
you are not smoking again.
---

You know it's not ladylike.
---

## OLIVIA:
Ladylike?
What is ladylike, Charles?
---

## CHARLES:
[laughs] Oh, you know.
---

## OLIVIA:
I actually don't know.
---

Would you please be so kind
as to inform me?
---

## CHARLES:
[chuckles] Ladylike
is being a wife,
---

a mother, a nurturer.
---

It's doing what you just did
in the bedroom with your husband.
---

## OLIVIA:
It sounds like it means
being attached to a man.
---

## CHARLES:
Oh, is anything wrong with that?
---

## OLIVIA:
[chuckles] You tell me.
---

Would there be anything wrong
---

if I just stop doing the things
I just did with you in the bedroom?
---

## CHARLES:
Well, you would be going
against the number one ladylike thing.
---

## OLIVIA:
Well, since that's
the number one ladylike thing to do,
---

that's what I'll stop doing.
---

## CHARLES:
Wait, wait, what you--
---

## OLIVIA:
Oh, would you listen to that, you
already aren't talking right without me.
---

[chuckles] Boy, if you don't cut it out.
---

I said quit it, Charles.
---

Charles.
---

Charles, quit it now.
---

Get up.
Get up, Charles. Charles?
---

Charles, Charles, Charles, Charles.
---

## CHARLES:
[laughs] [claps]
Charles, Charles.
---

## OLIVIA:
Boy, you scared me half to death.
## CHARLES:
So did you.
---

You see what happens when you just talk
---

about not doing
the number one ladylike thing.
---

It can kill you.
---

## OLIVIA:
What you want for breakfast, boy?
--

## CHARLES:
Well, I'm really not that hungry.
---

I just did enough eating.
---

## OLIVIA:
How can a reverend be so nasty?
--

## CHARLES:
It's in my nature.
---

It's what makes him manlike,
and it's not nasty if it's with my wife.
---

I'm only reminding her
that I can still put it down.
---

## OLIVIA:
Well, I'll make my husband,
---

who seems to be so full from this morning,
some toast.
---

Can you do me a favor
and eat some toast then?
---

## CHARLES:
Well, I can eat more than that.
## OLIVIA:
You'll be fine with toast for now.
---

[chuckles]
---

[pause]
---

## OLIVIA:
Here's your toast.
---

## CHARLES:
Oh, thank you.
---

Whoa, what's wrong?
We need to go to the doctor?
---

## OLIVIA:
No, everything's fine.
I have an appointment tomorrow.
---

## CHARLES:
What's wrong?
--

## OLIVIA:
Nothing's wrong.
---

The baby just moved again.
---

## CHARLES:
[screams] Really?
--

## OLIVIA:
Yes.
---

You trying to hear it talk?
---

## CHARLES:
It talks inside there.
--

## OLIVIA:
I hope not yet. [chuckles] Here.
---

## CHARLES:
Oh, I felt it.
--

## OLIVIA:
The baby didn't move, Charles.
---

## CHARLES:
It didn't?
--

## OLIVIA:
No.
---

## CHARLES:
No.
---

## OLIVIA:
You feel it? It just moved.
--

## CHARLES:
No.
---

## OLIVIA:
It's moving.
---

Oh, maybe it's too light for you to feel.
---

## CHARLES:
Well, I think I feel-- [laughs]
---

I don't know. Maybe.
---

God, I always knew
you would bear my child.
---

You remember the first time
I told you you would?
---

## OLIVIA:
When we were out
in the field picking tobacco?
---

## CHARLES:
We was no more than 13 or 14.
---

## OLIVIA:
That's why you were so busy trying
to impress me, picking all that tobacco.
---

## CHARLES:
Yes.
The sun was set on hell that day,
---

but I picked most tobacco
than the grown men
---

and Robert Jameson
didn't even give me a penny.
---

## OLIVIA:
Because you were
so busy trying to impress me.
---

All the tobacco you picked
was ripped all up.
---

You was just pulling the tobacco off
the ground and throwing it in your bag.
---

Not even looking.
I did a better job than you.
---

## CHARLES:
The point is, I knew
you were going to be mine and have mine.
---

You knew you'd be
the mother of my kids, didn't you?
---

## OLIVIA:
No.
--

## CHARLES:
No?
---

## OLIVIA:
Yes, no.
---

## CHARLES:
Because it was
when we were in college,
---

and I would leave my dorm
and meet you at yours,
---

and we'd go for walks.
You knew then, right?
---

## OLIVIA:
No.
---

## CHARLES:
No?
--

## OLIVIA:
Yes, no.
---

## CHARLES:
Because it was
when we got married.
---

Your mom was hooping and hauling
and catching the Holy Ghost
---

and she stopped, looked at us, and said,
---

"Y'all going to give me some pretty
grand babies." You knew then, right?
---

## OLIVIA:
No.
---

## CHARLES:
Well, when did you know then,
woman? [chuckles]
---

## OLIVIA:
I never did,
but this baby knew four months ago
---

when I got pregnant with it.
---

It only slightly let me know
when it first kicked.
---

That's how I knew something
was really in there.
---

[laughs]
---

Oh, the baby even thinks it's funny.
Feel it moving. [laughs]
---

This baby always knew we'd be its parents.
---

## CHARLES:
You didn't.
## OLIVIA:
Honey.
---

## CHARLES:
Well, you didn't.
Not until you got pregnant. [chuckles]
---

## OLIVIA:
The only boy I ever thought
---

could be the father of my children
was this scrawny,
---

stuttering something,
---

who was so nervous to get his first teen
sermon in front of the church
---

that he stole my poem,
---

and read it [chuckles]
as if it were his own,
---

but the way that thief made my words sing,
---

I wanted to have his babies
right then and there.
---

## CHARLES:
In the church?
## OLIVIA:
On the altar.
---

## CHARLES:
Oh, you a heathen.
## OLIVIA:
That was before I was saved.
---

## CHARLES:
I did not steal your poem,
I borrowed it.
---

## OLIVIA:
Yes.
---

[bomb sounds]
---

## CHARLES:
What?
---

Bombs again?
---

Why don't you go lay down for a bit, Liv.
I will get you some water.
---

[phone rings] Relax, I'll get it.
---

## OLIVIA:
It's all right, I'm already up.
---

Grace Residence, this is Olivia.
---

Oh hi, Francine, how are you
and little Jimmy holding up?
---

[silence]
---

Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.
---

Well, if there is anything I can do.
---

Well, Charles is still come down
to speak to you,
---

and I'll be sending some flowers.
---

Again, I'm sorry.
---

Hold on to God's unwavering hand.
---

I'll be keeping you in my prayers
---

and I'll be in touch.
---

Bye, Francine.
---

## CHARLES:
Who is Francine?
---

## OLIVIA:
You remember the boy
I told you about in Charlotte,
---

the one that was arrested?
---

## CHARLES:
Yes.
## OLIVIA:
That was his mom.
---

She called to tell me
that you don't need to come down,
---

and speak to him anymore because.
---

## CHARLES:
What happened?
---

## OLIVIA:
Well, you know he was in jail
---

because a White woman said he touched her-
---

## CHARLES:
Like always.
## OLIVIA:
-but he didn't.
---

## CHARLES:
Like always.
---

## OLIVIA:
Of course, a White woman's word
is the law, so they put him in jail.
---

Francine said,
when they found him this morning-
---

## CHARLES:
It's okay. Go on.
---

## OLIVIA:
When they found him this morning,
---

he was lying in a pool of his own blood.
---

## CHARLES:
Oh, Lord.
---

## OLIVIA:
You should have heard
Francine's voice,
---

the tired in it, the hopelessness in it,
---

and she was trying to be so strong
and talking to me,
---

but her voice, it was so thin
and broken.
---

She could barely get her words out.
---

[crying]
---

He was her only child,
---

he was only 13.
---

[bomb sounds]
---

Let me get your speech
for the girl's funeral tomorrow.
---

## CHARLES:
Oh, no, we don't want to do that
right now.
---

## OLIVIA:
We do.
## CHARLES:
It's okay. Come here.
---

## OLIVIA:
Let me go, Charles. Let me go.
---

I said, let me go.
---

I have to get your speech.
---

[pause]
---

## OLIVIA:
What do you think?
## CHARLES:
Is really good.
---

## OLIVIA:
Good, let me hear it.
## CHARLES:
Now?
---

## OLIVIA:
You came back here,
so I can help you prepare.
---

The funeral's tomorrow morning,
you have to be ready.
---

Now, go on.
---

## CHARLES:
What is hope? How can you see
it when your eyes are filled with tears?
---

How can you feel it when your hands are
too busy picking up your broken pieces?
---

What is hope? It is a long-
---

## OLIVIA:
You have to go up, one up.
---

## CHARLES:
What is hope?
---

How can you see it when your eyes
are filled with tears?
---

How can you feel it when your hands are
too busy picking up your broken pieces?
---

What is hope? It is a long-
---

## OLIVIA:
You have to go one up, one up.
---

You have to take a moment
before completing the question.
---

## CHARLES:
What is hope?
---

## CHARLES:
How can you see it when-
## OLIVIA:
-to rise up with you,
---

so that they can feel strong enough
to pick up their broken pieces.
---

That is where the hope comes from.
---

## CHARLES:
Are you going to let me finish?
---

Okay. What is hope?
---

How can you see it
when your eyes are filled with tears?
---

How can you feel it when your hands
are too busy
---

picking up your broken pieces?
---

What is hope?
---

It is a long road covered in heart-
---

## OLIVIA:
Stretch out the word "long".
---

## CHARLES:
Olivia, would you let me read
the damn speech, please?
---

I have been all over this country
uniting folks for years.
---

I know what I am doing, okay?
---

You can give me notes after. All right.
---

## OLIVIA:
You would think
that after all these years of doing this,
---

I wouldn't have to give you
notes anymore.
---

With all the standing in front of so many
pulpits and cameras,
---

you know how to talk to
and lead people without my help,
---

or better yet,
I wouldn't have to write your speeches.
---

## CHARLES:
Yes, hold your tongue, Olivia.
---

## OLIVIA:
You would think
there will come a time
---

I don't have to write these speeches,
---

a time where death stops trying to be
a collect person's best friend.
---

I am tired of having to write a eulogy
for flowers that wilted too soon.
---

[bomb sound]
---

I keep asking myself, what is it
going to take for things to change?
---

What?
---

After I wait for an answer
that never comes,
---

I asked myself,
"Is Charles really making a difference?"
---

Then, when I realized
I have to answer myself, I say, no,
---

because if he was,
things would be different.
---

You ain't doing shit for this world,
Charles, not a damn thing.
---

## CHARLES:
I'm going to go for a walk.
---

[pause]
---

## OLIVIA:
September 17th 1963.
---

Dear God,
---

I don't want this baby.
---

I never did,
---

I never, not once asked for it.
---

I found myself seriously thinking back
---

on every moment in my life
---

to see if I ever gave you
the impression that I did.
---

What I constantly land on,
is that I did it.
---

Not once, so how dare you give it to me?
---

What gives you
the right to give it to me?
---

Do you ever happened to think
about me and this decision,
---

about what I wanted?
---

What infuriates me the most
is that you led me to believe
---

that I couldn't have children,
and yet, here I am with a child.
---

Now, I'm supposed to walk around happy.
---

This is something I was waiting for,
yearning for?
---

Like this is a gift.
---

If anything,
---

this baby is that unpleasant present
under the Christmas tree
---

that you never played with,
---

that you wish you could just pass on
to someone else.
---

God, you are that someone else,
---

you're taking this thing back,
and you're giving me my sanity
---

and my happiness to make it
in this evil world you got me in instead.
---

Don't you talk to me about it, you can't.
---

Because if I am down here
as a colored woman,
---

making something out of nothing every day,
you can do this one little thing.
---

You are going to do this one little thing.
---

Please, do this for me.
---

Please take this baby back.
---

It has no place in this world.
---

I wish it did, but it's colored,
---

so it won't, so you have to take it back.
---

You have to.
---

Oh, please take this baby back.
---

Take this baby back.
Take it back.
---

Take it back. Take it back.
Take it back. Take it back.
---

Take it back now,
---

because if you don't,
---

I'm giving it back.
---

[singing]
---

[pause]
---

## CHARLES:
[chuckles]
---

[silence]
---

Olivia.
---

[silence]
---

Liv.
---

[silence]
---

I got you some ice cream.
---

It's strawberry,
[chuckles] your favorite.
---

Like I used back on our walks in college.
---

[silence]
---

You want some?
---

[silence]
---

Hey, look, Liv,
---

I'm sorry.
---

Being the face of this movement
is taxing.
---

I drink a little because of it,
because it settles me,
---

and because I was drinking earlier,
---

that accompanied
with the things you were saying,
---

I just--
---

I'm sorry.
---

[pause]

---

## CHARLES:
[chuckles] What are you doing?
---

## OLIVIA:
Smoking.
---

## CHARLES:
Take that cigarette
out of your mouth, Liv.
---

## OLIVIA:
Ain't no need.
---

## CHARLES:
Well, you don't need
to be smoking.
---

## OLIVIA:
There's a lot of things
I don't need to be doing.
---

## CHARLES:
You know I don't like you smoking.
## OLIVIA:
Why?
---

I'm not ladylike anymore?
---

You been gone all day.
---

What you been doing, smoking?
---

Where's your cigarette?
---

## CHARLES:
What are you talking about, Liv?
What cigarette?
---

## OLIVIA:
Before you left for Birmingham,
---

there was a cigarette
in your jacket's pocket.
---

It wasn't there when you got back.
---

## CHARLES:
No, there wasn't a cigarette
in my pocket, Liv.
---

## OLIVIA:
It was.
## CHARLES:
No, it was not, Olivia.
---

## OLIVIA:
I put it there before you left.
---

Where is it?
---

## CHARLES:
Calvin must've took it.
---

You know how nervous
he gets on these trips,
---

marching and fighting and all.
---

He must've took it out of my pocket
---

when it was hanging up and smoked it.
---

I didn't even know it was in there.
You want me to get you some ice cream?
---

## OLIVIA:
How did Calvin know
you had a cigarette in your pocket?
---

## CHARLES:
I don't know, Liv.
---

He must have needed one to calm him
so bad, he just checked.
---

## OLIVIA:
How did he know
to check your pocket?
---

## CHARLES:
I don't know, Liv.
---

I'm going to go pack.
I leave in a few hours.
---

## OLIVIA:
I'm the only one who knows
you only smoke after sex.
---

I put that cigarette in your pocket,
---

Sunday afternoon, before you left,
---

and you come back home last night
with no cigarette in your pocket.
---

You are lowdown and you trifling.
---

## CHARLES:
Because I don't have
a cigarette in my pocket,
---

I'm lowdown and trifling.
---

Your tongue has been
very malicious lately.
---

Is that a side effect of the pregnancy?
---

## OLIVIA:
[chuckles] It's a side effect
of me giving my heart to you.
---

## CHARLES:
I did not sleep
with anyone while I was away.
---

I never have, I never wanted to,
and I never will. Okay?
---

What I am going to do,
is go pack and rest for a little bit.
---

I am sorry if I made you think
anything other than I love you.
---

Machine: [moaning]
---

"Yes, yes. You like that, don't you?
You feel real good."
---

## OLIVIA:
What were you saying
about loving me?
---

That package came while you were away.
---

It was addressed to me.
---

I was so scared to open it.
---

I didn't want to open it,
but while you were on your walk,
---

something told me that I should.
---

I'm sure it is probably
from the FBI since they do,
---

"Any ole incredulous thing."
---

I put that cigarette in your pocket
---

because deep down,
something told me you were lowdown.
---

I searched for the cigarette
when you got back,
---

and when I didn't find it, I still
couldn't bring myself to believe it.
---

I didn't want to believe it,
---

but then this message.
---

I dedicated so much to this movement.
---

I poured all of me into it, into you.
---

My whole world is you.
My life is you.
---

I don't even know who I am.
---

I don't even speak for myself.
---

My words come out of your mouth.
Can't help but ask myself, was it worth it?
---

Was losing me in all of this,
in you, worth it?
---

## CHARLES:
They did this to break us, Liv.
## OLIVIA:
No. You broke us by doing this.
---

## CHARLES:
I'm sorry.
## OLIVIA:
That's all you got, a sorry?
---

## CHARLES:
It's everything I got, my word.
## OLIVIA:
Ha.
---

You don't even have that
because your words are mine.
---

Mine, and I wasted them all on you,
every single one.
---

Just like the time I wasted on you
that I can't get back.
---

## CHARLES:
I'm sorry.
---

## OLIVIA:
Don't you think I wanted more,
that my dreams didn't end with you?
---

## CHARLES:
I am so sorry.
---

## OLIVIA:
Is that really
all you're going to say?
---

## CHARLES:
I don't know what else to say.
## OLIVIA:
Who was she, Charles?
---

You could say that.
---

## CHARLES:
What good is that going to do?
## OLIVIA:
Who was she?
---

## CHARLES:
I don't know.
---

## OLIVIA:
Because it was that many
that you could've been caught with?
---

How many?
---

## CHARLES:
What good is knowing
that going to do?
---

## OLIVIA:
Charles Emmanuel Grace, how many?
---

[silence]
---

It was that many?
---

You only touch me when you come back
from your trips,
---

and that's probably
because you take pity on me,
---

or you feel bad
from all the sinning you've been doing
---

that you feel like you need to repent
in me.
---

## CHARLES:
Before I got back
from Birmingham,
---

we hadn’t made love
since the beginning of the summer.
---

## OLIVIA:
Wow.
Yet I've managed not to sleep with anyone.
---

Don't you think I wanted to?
---

I never been with nobody else
but you, ever.
---

Don't you think I wanted to feel
the touch of someone else's lips
---

on my neck and fingers
crawling up my body?
---

You don't think that ever crossed
my mind in those months
---

we lay next to each other in that bed
like corpses?
---

## CHARLES:
I could have given that to you.
## OLIVIA:
Who said I wanted it to be you?
---

## CHARLES:
Wow.
Who did you want it to be with then?
---

Who?
---

## OLIVIA:
Who?
## CHARLES:
Who.
---

## OLIVIA:
Somebody, anybody.
## CHARLES:
Somebody like Ruby?
---

I know about her.
---

[laughs]
---

Oh.
---

I found these a few months ago.
---

My ring fell in a floorboard once,
---

and when I go to get it,
I found all these letters.
---

At first, I don't think much of it,
---

but there were just so many.
---

Hundreds. I had to read them,
---

all of them.
---

I see they are all addressed to Ruby.
---

Got nothing to say now.
---

Because you've got so much
to say in these letters.
---

The first one, "June 3rd, 1960,
---

Dear Ruby, Hi, I just wanted to write
---

because I'm thinking about all the joy
it brought me to be around you
---

those many years ago.
---

I've never been able to feel the way I did
---

like when I was in your presence."
---

Another one, "September 30th, 1960,
---

Dear Ruby, How is New York?
---

I wish I could be there with you.
---

Until I do, writing will have to suffice.
---

If this is the only way
I can be with you for now,
---

I'll consider it a blessing."
---

Oh, listen to this one, [laughs]
---

"February 15th, 1963,
Dear Ruby, I really miss you.
---

I wish I were with you instead of Charles.
---

I think about you often.
---

I think about your smile,
about your touch,
---

about what your skin would feel like
against mine,
---

your body against my body.
---

I think about you touching all of me,
kissing all of me,
---

feeling your lips between my thighs,
---

on my lips.
---

I think about you so much."
---

This was on our anniversary,
---

Olivia, our anniversary.
---

Letter after letter after letter,
---

I realized you don't love me
the way I love you.
---

The way you were writing to her.
---

Letter after Godforsaken letter,
I felt my heart break.
---

These go back years, Olivia, years.
---

After I found them,
I tried to act like they didn't exist.
---

They weren't real.
---

I thought if I just stopped thinking
about them, they'd just go away,
---

but I couldn't stop thinking about them.
---

I couldn't stop thinking about Ruby.
---

Who is she?
Why is she so special to you?
---

The more questions I started asking,
---

the more I found myself
not even being able to look at you,
---

let alone sleep in the same bed as you.
---

[chuckles] God.
---

All the dirt you busy tracking
in and out our sheets,
---

and you got the nerve
to tell me that I am trifling.
---

You don't think you're trifling too?
---

You don't think you're trifling either?
---

Who is she?
---

Huh?
Who?
---

Say something, Olivia.
Say something.
---

## OLIVIA:
I don't want to be with you
anymore.
---

## CHARLES:
Because you want to go
sinning with Ruby?
---

You want to lay up with her
---

under God and defy Him?
---

I ain't saying what I did was right,
but, at least, what I did wasn't sick.
---

Who is she?
---

Who is this unholy woman
---

that got you not wanting to be
with me anymore?
---

You're always able to find
the right words,
---

but now you're speechless?
---

Who is she?
---

Who?
---

## OLIVIA:
An organizer
from New York,
---

who was visiting family to hear
the famous Reverend Grace preach.
---

When she left me,
---

whenever I'd see her family at services,
I'd ask about her,
---

trying to sound
as unassuming as I could.
---

Sometime later,
---

right before I started writing her,
I run into one of her cousins.
---

He had some liquor in him
---

when he tells me Ruby
was an ungodly woman,
---

so some man tried to turn her
into a right kind of woman.
---

I'm sure he wanted to turn her
ladylike, right?
---

After he get through with her,
---

he killed her.
---

You saying all the things
you saying about her,
---

and she dead.
---

I never sent the letters, but if I did,
she wouldn't' have wrote back.
---

I have just been writing a ghost.
---

That's all that is.
---

## CHARLES:
Well,
---

it's a good thing she's gone.
---

## OLIVIA:
That's why I don't want to be
with you no more.
---

That's why.
---

It has nothing to do with Ruby,
---

and everything to do with you
not being a good man to me.
---

## CHARLES:
[laughs] I'm not a good man.
---

## OLIVIA:
It's taken me some years to see it,
but you aren't.
---

I had a light that burned so bright.
---

You know what I wanted to do with my life?
Do you?
---

## CHARLES:
I hope it's not
what you're doing right now.
---

## OLIVIA:
What am I doing?
---

I'm married to a man who cheats on me,
and carrying his baby
---

that I don't want to have.
---

I've been praying, writing to God a lot,
---

asking to take this baby back.
---

## CHARLES:
Okay, you don't mean that.
## OLIVIA:
Yes I do.
---

This world ain’t no place
for a colored child to call home.
---

They’re dying every day.
---

You said it yourself, "Death greeting
colored folk at their front door."
---

## CHARLES:
We’re working.
---

We’re working to change that,
---

Olivia, to make things better
for the next generation.
---

## OLIVIA:
The generation
that just got bombed
---

while getting ready to praise the Lord?
---

The generation that just got mutilated
while sitting in a jailhouse?
---

## CHARLES:
The one that you are carrying
in your stomach right now,
---

to make things better for that one.
---

## OLIVIA:
I don’t want to have
this one, Charles, and I’m not.
---

I’m not having this baby.
---

## CHARLES:
[chuckles] What do you mean?
You've got to.
---

## OLIVIA:
No, I don’t.
## CHARLES:
Yes, you do.
---

## OLIVIA:
Says who?
---

## CHARLES:
Says me, says the baby
that is in your stomach.
---

## OLIVIA:
Don’t I get a say in this?
---

It seems like everybody
deciding on things about me without me.
---

Don’t I get a choice
in what I want to do with my body?
---

## CHARLES:
You made the choice
---

when you let me inside your body.
---

## OLIVIA:
I thought long and hard
about this, Charles, and I’m--
---

## CHARLES:
You’re what? What, Olivia?
---

## OLIVIA:
I’m taking care of it.
---

## CHARLES:
Taking care of it?
## OLIVIA:
Yes.
---

I talked to a few women
and got the name of someone
---

who comes highly recommended.
---

I have an appointment tomorrow.
---

## CHARLES:
Appointment?
What are you talking about?
---

## OLIVIA:
Tomorrow,
---

while you’re preaching
at those little girls’ funeral,
---

I’m getting rid of this baby.
---

## CHARLES:
Like hell you are.
## OLIVIA:
It’s happening.
---

## CHARLES:
No, it’s not.
## OLIVIA:
What are you going to do, Charles?
---

Not preach?
---

## CHARLES:
I’m not.
I won’t preach.
---

I’ll get Calvin to do it.
---

## OLIVIA:
You’re
one of the faces of the Movement,
---

and out of everybody,
they want you to preach.
---

## CHARLES:
Fuck the Movement.
---

If it is between the Movement and my baby,
---

I choose my baby.
I’m not going anywhere.
---

I’m not letting you hurt my child.
---

## OLIVIA:
You’re really not going to do
what you’ve been called to do,
---

by helping transition
those little girls home?
---

## CHARLES:
Why are you doing this?
---

Did you stop and think
about me once in any of this?
---

## OLIVIA:
You didn’t stop to think about me
---

when you were laying down
with other women.
---

## CHARLES:
We are talking
about a baby now, Olivia.
---

Not sex.
---

## OLIVIA:
Isn’t that how you make a baby?
---

The last time I checked, it was.
---

I’m not having this baby, Charles.
---

[background noise]
---

This your rage coming out again?
---

That fire you got inside you
going to make you hit me like you used to?
---

## CHARLES:
That was one time.
---

## OLIVIA:
Time, too many from one,
too many drinks.
---

## CHARLES:
You just get the final say, huh?
---

## OLIVIA:
[pants]
## CHARLES:
Hey, it's okay. It's okay.
---

## OLIVIA:
I'm self suffocating.
---

[sobs] This fire.
---

Oh, it's so hot
and this smoke is so thick.
---

I can't see me anymore.
---

I try to listen and see if I can still hear
me somewhere deep down, but I don't.
---

Ever since I found out
I'm pregnant with this miracle,
---

bombs just keep going off in my head,
---

making me feel like I'm losing myself.
[sobs]
---

These bombs just keep exploding
over and over again,
---

I can't have this baby.
---

I keep exploding over and over again.
---

The letters, my letters.
What are you doing Charles?
---

Give me my letters, give them to me.
Please.
---

## CHARLES:
No.
---

## OLIVIA:
Please,
give me my letters, Charles.
---

## CHARLES:
I said no.
---

I should have burned these
like I did those others.
---

## OLIVIA:
What are you doing Charles?
No. Stop it, just stop it.
---

## CHARLES:
What are you going to do?
Kill me? I am tired, Liv.
---

I am tired of pretending
everything is okay.
---

When people ask me, "How Liv doing?"
Day in, day out, that is all I hear.
---

Day in, and day out,
I try to get you better.
---

You aren't well.
---

Thinking that the sky
is on fire,
---

hearing bombs in your head,
staring off family,
---

telling me I should send you somewhere,
get you the help you need,
---

but I don't. I'll just be praying for you.
---

Praying for your peace of mind,
praying that you get better,
---

and I am tired.
---

Now, I have poured
so much of myself into so much, of you.
---

You were the one who lit this fire in me,
okay?
---

To lead our people to this smoke,
---

and I just want my child to see
the difference that I am making.
---

Just give me that.
---

Please.
---

[pause]
---

## OLIVIA:
[cries]
---

[pause]
---

## CHARLES:
[laughs]
---

[pause]
---

## CHARLES:
Smoking.
---

## OLIVIA:
Drinking?
## CHARLES:
No.
---

Not liquor, at least.
This, here, water.
---

## OLIVIA:
Then that smoke you smell
isn't coming from me,
---

it's coming from the sky.
---

## CHARLES:
You always been a bad liar.
---

## OLIVIA:
You always been a dumb liar.
## CHARLES:
You got me there.
---

## OLIVIA:
You're still drinking?
---

Shouldn't you be on your way?
---

## CHARLES:
I am waiting for Calvin.
---

He's on his way to pick me up right now.
---

## OLIVIA:
I hope you have
a sober sermon tomorrow.
---

Goodnight.
---

## CHARLES:
Wait. Wait.
---

Dance with me.
---

## OLIVIA:
No. Charles, I'm going to bed.
## CHARLES:
Please.
---

I know I done really messed up.
---

You probably
don't even want to look at me,
---

let alone touch me,
but now, please, just dance with me.
---

I know you're not mine no more.
---

[chuckles] After you do,
and we stop, and I let you go,
---

I will let you dance
into your forever, alone.
---

Please, please.
---

[sings]
Darling you send me.
---

I know you [hums] send me.
---

[hums] Honest, you do,
Honest, you do.
---

Honest, you do.
---

Oh, you thrill me, [hums]
---

I know you, come on, come on,
you'll ever thrill me.
---

[?]
I know you feel me, yes.
---

Honest, you do.
Honest, you do.
---

Honest, you do.
---

You don't love me no more? [chuckles]
---

## OLIVIA:
That's not it.
## CHARLES:
What is it?
---

## OLIVIA:
Your breath stinks, Charles.
---

## CHARLES:
Your breath stinks too.
---

## OLIVIA:
[laughs]
---

You're the same as when we were little.
---

Tit for tat.
---

## CHARLES:
[laughs] Yes, I was that way
when I was little, what not?
---

## OLIVIA:
You sure was, a mess.
---

Remember when I tried to help you
with your stuttering?
---

Tell you to calm down,
take your time when you speak.
---

Let the words catch up
so you don't got to catch up to them.
---

Remember what you'd always tell me?
---

"Well, at least, I'm not a girl."
---

## CHARLES:
[laughs]
---

Together: People will still listen to me
even if I stutter.
---

## OLIVIA:
You were a mean,
old tipper tapper stuttering boy.
---

## CHARLES:
Oh God, I was, wasn't I? [laughs]
## OLIVIA:
You sure was.
---

Whenever I'd say, "Fine."
---

## CHARLES:
[laughs]
---

## OLIVIA:
Whenever I'd say, "Fine.
Go on and stutter, I don’t care.
---

I’m not helping you anymore, and I
don’t want to see you anymore neither.
---

You just start this ugly cry.
---

Eyes get all big, snot instantly
starts running down your nose.
---

## CHARLES:
[laughs] Oh, I wouldn't do that.
---

## OLIVIA:
You sure would.
---

## CHARLES:
[laughs] [cries]
---

I've always loved you, Liv.
---

Even when we was kids, I always did.
---

You sure you don't want to have this baby?
---

[car honking]
---

Is there anything I can do
to make you feel different?
---

I'll give up drinking, how about that?
---

I'll never even
look at another drink again.
---

See?
---

Look, look, Liv.
---

I am a new man, okay?
---

Have this new Charles’ baby.
---

Please.
---

[car honking]
---

## OLIVIA:
That's probably Calvin,
you should get going.
---

## CHARLES:
No. Not until you tell me
you'll have this baby.
---

## OLIVIA:
I can't tell you that.
## CHARLES:
Why?
---

## OLIVIA:
Because I can't.
## CHARLES:
Damn it, Liv.
---

Okay, Liv, if Ruby were asking you
---

what I am asking you,
would you say yes to her?
---

You two must have had something
real special, huh?
---

Better than what we ever had, huh?
---

You could tell me that, at least.
---

## OLIVIA:
Ruby and I,
---

we only met once,
---

at your service.
---

It was a short conversation
---

that I tried really hard
to get out of my head but I couldn't.
---

It was just something about her
that I can't shake.
---

It was like I finally found myself.
---

I don't even know if she felt for me
---

the way I felt for her
but every time I think about her,
---

I think about the fire she had.
---

I see the fire she had.
---

It was everywhere,
---

it was burning so bright.
---

## CHARLES:
You didn't even know her?
---

## OLIVIA:
No.
---

## CHARLES:
You made up an entire life
with this woman.
---

All you had was those letters?
---

## OLIVIA:
Yes.
---

## CHARLES:
What if I told you I didn't burn
the other letters you wrote to Ruby?
---

If I gave those letters back, all of them,
---

would you have the baby then?
---

Listen, we never thought we
would have a child, Liv, but here we are.
---

So just have this baby for me, please,
and after you do, you can leave.
---

You could live whatever life you want,
---

you can sin in whatever ways
your heart desires,
---

just, please, don't take my blessing
from me.
---

Just give me my baby,
that is all I am asking.
---

That's it.
---

That's all, and I'll give you
these letters for that.
---

Would you have the baby for these letters?
---

I need to know now.
---

## OLIVIA:
Yes. Yes, I would have the baby
for the letters, just give them to me.
---

## CHARLES:
Not until I'm holding my baby.
---

That's the only way
I know you're true to your word,
---

but I will give you this letter.
---

I wrote it not too long ago
when you was out there on the porch.
---

I hope you read it
---

and I hope you know I meant
every word of it.
---

I love you.
---

How did we get here?
[car honking]
---

[music]
---

[phone ringing]
---

## OLIVIA:
September 18th, 1963.
---

Dear God,
---

I went to take care of the baby,
---

to give it back to you.
---

I know what I said to Charles, I know
having this baby will give me back Ruby,
---

but I couldn't do it.
---

I couldn't keep it.
---

The doctor I went to,
to take care of the baby,
---

the one that came so highly recommended,
---

wanted me to pay him with more than money.
---

When I told him I wouldn't do it,
---

he said he wouldn't do it,
---

so I ended up giving him more than money.
---

I can still smell him on me.
---

I can still feel him on me.
---

After he finished doing
his business with me,
---

he couldn’t take care of the business
I needed done to me.
---

He said, "You Reverend Grace's wife,
I can't kill God's grace."
---

He couldn't kill God's grace
but he could lay down with it.
---

I can't have this baby.
---

I can't. I won’t.
---

I won’t have this baby.
---

So, God, You got to tell me,
---

what do I do? Huh?
---

What do I do? Tell me.
---

Please.
What do I do?
---

[phone ringing]
---

Grace residence.
This is Olivia.
---

Hi Calvin. How are you?
---

I’m good.
I’m just starting my day.
---

How did things go with the service?
---

What?
Why didn’t y’all make it?
---

What? Where is Charles?
---

What? Calvin, you know
I don’t like them kind of jokes now.
---

You and Charles
and the other boys can joke like that,
---

but don’t bring that my way.
---

How did a bomb get in the car?
---

Where were you when it happened?
---

I need to call his mother.
I have to go.
---

Oh, no.
---

[cries] Oh,
---

no, no.
---

## CHARLES:
My dearest Olivia.
---

I am not as eloquent as you are.
---

I am not going to try to be.
I'm just going to be honest.
---

I constantly thank God
for placing you in my life.
---

You are perfect,
and I'm not used to perfection.
---

I'm not used to standing before God.
---

You have made me constantly
wonder, repeatedly,
---

if God is a colored woman.
---

From the moment I laid eyes on you,
I knew God was real,
---

and it was my purpose
to do the work of the Lord.
---

Your smile is like the rising sun.
---

Your skin is like millions of prayers
being answered.
---

Between your thighs, Lord,
that is a baptism
---

that saves me over and over again.
---

It breaks my heart to know
that I have fallen short of your glory.
---

I will forever ask, until the day I die,
that you forgive me.
---

It is my hope that you will
because like the speech
---

where those four little girls say,
---

"Hope is like the highest mountain,
---

stands firm and cannot be moved.
---

The higher you allow hope to take you,
---

the closer you get to seeing
your purpose on the other side."
---

I will be on the other side waiting,
hoping to see you there.
---

I know I no longer have a place
in your heart,
---

but, please, know that you occupy
all of mine.
---

I will be sure to give that love
to our child.
---

I would teach it to understand love.
---

I would teach it that it is
a child of God, that its Mother is God,
---

that is all a colored child needs to know
to make it in this world.
---

I know I may have said otherwise,
---

but whenever you come around,
---

if you ever do,
---

you are welcome in this child's life,
---

now and always,
---

just like my love for you.
---

Then, now, and always.
---

Love beyond the day I die.
Charles.
---

## OLIVIA:
Charles, Charles, Charles.
---

I don't know.
---

I don't know what to do with you.
---

[music]
---

## OLIVIA:
Dear God.
---

No, dear Ruby.
---

Dear God,
---

dear Ruby, dear sky,
---

dear fire,
---

dear Charles.
---

I laid you to rest today, Charles.
---

I thought that I would cry,
but I didn't.
---

Not once.
---

I guess
I really have gotten used to the deaths,
---

to losing those I love.
---

First you, Ruby, then you Charles.
---

After this funeral, there was
a line of people waiting to view you
---

and to offer me their condolences.
---

I couldn't see the line but Calvin told me
it wrapped around the church
---

about 10 times.
---

I thought it would just be about an hour,
---

but I ended up staying there
greeting people
---

until close to 12:00 AM, this morning.
---

In the first few hours, they kept
telling me I could go to get some rest
---

for the burial in the morning.
---

Every time they told me to go home
and get some rest, I'd say,
---

"My husband is getting enough rest
for the both of us.
---

I'm fine right here by his side,
---

I'm not leaving him."
---

Eventually, they finally realized
I wasn't leaving you,
---

so they went and got me a chair.
---

All kinds of people
came to pay their respects.
---

Men, women, kids,
---

Coloreds, Whites, Asians, everybody.
---

It would have filled your heart
to see them all.
---

What struck me was the very last person
who came to pay their respects.
---

It was this real old woman
---

who looked like she could have been
older than God, if I can be honest.
---

Since not many people
knew we were expecting,
---

you can understand
why I was taken aback by her asking,
---

"How are you going to raise your baby?"
---

I cut her off before she could say
without Reverend Grace.
---

I study her for a bit wondering
who she was, before I answer.
---

Understanding its place in this world
as a Colored person,
---

teaching it that his father fought hard
---

for it to live in the world
that it's living in today.
---

I told her, "I pray it's a girl
---

so I can raise her to know she is God.
---

Raise a child that knows it is love.
---

The old woman smiles very sweetly
and just disappears out the church,
---

and I just stood there
wishing you weren't gone, Charles.
---

Wishing I got to know you better Ruby.
---

I stood in that church by myself,
---

holding my belly filled with you,
little baby.
---

I was listening to the quiet,
---

trying to hear what to do with you.
---

I am wondering,
do I spare you from this world
---

or do I bring you into it, so you can be
here for the changes your daddy died for,
---

for you to be that reflection of God
that will further change things.
---

I just stood there
listening for an answer.
---

Wow, feeling the words
I spoke at your service, Charles.
---

You should have heard me,
I was preaching.
---

Now, I don't quite have your charisma,
---

but I did have your heart,
---

I hope I made you proud.
---

The whole church clapped and hooped
and hollered and Amen
---

for almost 10 minutes, from my words,
I kid you not,
---

and I felt it.
---

the moment you talked about
when you feel people's burdens get light.
---

I felt it all from my preaching.
---

Y'all want to hear what I told them?
---

Okay.
---

My great-granddaddy,
Henry, was born a slave.
---

On the plantation he lived at,
---

was a tall, tall tree that some said
went straight up into heaven.
---

Every day, he climbed it
in hopes of getting to heaven
---

to ask God some questions.
---

He asked God,
---

"Why are we down here
being treated like this?
---

When will the pain and suffering end?
---

I think about my great-granddaddy
and those questions he asked God, often,
---

especially when I see fireflies.
---

God came to me in a dream once and told me
---

"We are all fireflies."
---

Every single one of us,
particularly us coloreds.
---

This world tries mighty hard to catch
and steal our light,
---

but we have to remember
that the power is in us,
---

so no one can ever steal our light
---

because we have a special assignment
---

given from the One who sits high
and looks low.
---

Our assignment is to fly.
---

We have to fly as high
as we possibly can.
---

We have to soar
because the higher we are,
---

the better we'll be in making
this world a brighter place.
---

Let's those little wings hum.
---

Fly on fireflies, fly on.
---

Not because you need to get
to the promised land
---

because it's already inside of us.
---

We have to fly on together,
---

just past the fiery sky
to that place of peace and love
---

that deep within us.
---

Because once we are all there,
the promises that's within will pour out
---

and shape this world into a glorious new.
---

A new where we won't have to ask,
---

"Why are we being treated like this?"
---

A new void of pain and suffering.
---

Fly on, fireflies,
---

with all the love you have,
---

and open up this with a resounding light.
---
