The Jigsaw Bride <br>
by Joseph Zettelmaier
---
---
## ANNOUNCER:
The producers feel
---
[spacer]
that it would be just a little bit unkind
---
[spacer]
to present this show without a word of friendly warning.
---
## &nbsp;
We are about to unfold a story,
---
## &nbsp;
that of Dr. Frankenstein’s other creature.
---
## &nbsp;
It is one of the
strangest tales ever told.
---
## &nbsp;
It deals with the two great
mysteries of creation:
---
## &nbsp;
Life and Death.
---
## &nbsp;
We think it will thrill you.
---
## &nbsp;
It may shock you. 
---
## &nbsp;
It might even horrify you.
---
## &nbsp;
So if any of you feel your
heart is not up to the strain,
---
## &nbsp;
now is the time to…
---
## &nbsp;
well, we warned you.
---
## &nbsp;
Oh, and please remember to
keep on your masks at all time,
---
## &nbsp;
and to turn off your
cell phones and watches.

---
## MARIA:
To my learned colleagues
---
## &nbsp;
of Graubünden’s Natural Research Society.
---
## &nbsp;
I am pleased to report
---
## &nbsp;
that the excavation of the ruined keep in
---
## &nbsp;
the Genevan woodlands is now complete
---
## &nbsp;
and was a greater success
than I could have imagined.
---
## &nbsp;
The tomes I uncovered have
quite simply left me staggered.
---
## &nbsp;
Texts ranging from medieval philosophy
---
## &nbsp;
to medical treatises that
currently defy my understanding.
---
## &nbsp;
It is clear to me that whoever
last dwelled in this Schloss
---
## &nbsp;
was a man of great learning,
---
## &nbsp;
though I have yet to uncover his name.
---
## &nbsp;
Or perhaps *her* name.
---
## &nbsp;
The locals proved to be terribly secretive
---
## &nbsp;
regarding this abandoned manor.
---
## &nbsp;
Its owner, its history,
they would not speak of it.
---
## &nbsp;
Some, in fact, actively tried
to prevent my explorations.
---
## &nbsp;
A rather shocking number of my wagons
---
## &nbsp;
found themselves with broken wheels,
---
## &nbsp;
and many of the hired workers
---
## &nbsp;
proved too ill to leave their homes.
---
## &nbsp;
As well, you know, my family’s
wealth is not infinite.
---
## &nbsp;
But still I pressed onward.
---
## &nbsp;
I knew in my very soul,
whatever I spent would prove well worth it,
---
## &nbsp;
if even a fraction of
the legends proved true.
---
## &nbsp;
My friends, they have proven
more than true!
---
## &nbsp;
I strain to organize
my thoughts as I write this and
---
## &nbsp;
shall soon elaborate further
---
## &nbsp;
on my findings, once I have been able to…
---
## &nbsp;
…properly correlate my findings?
---
## &nbsp;
I thank you for your continued patience.
---
## &nbsp;
Most sincerely, 
---
## &nbsp;
M. von Moos.

---
## MARIA:
Ah, I see you found the library.
---
## &nbsp;
Well, *one* of the libraries.
---
## &nbsp;
I have three, actually.
---
## &nbsp;
Does that seem excessive?
---
## &nbsp;
I have a friend who once told me
---
## &nbsp;
there is no such thing as too many books.
---
## &nbsp;
Only not enough book _shelves_.
---
## &nbsp;
I think he was flirting in
his own scholarly way, the rogue.
---
## &nbsp;
And yet, he is not here
---
## &nbsp;
and all these books are, so…
---
## &nbsp;
Forgive me! You must be famished. Here.
---
## &nbsp;
I have brought you some
sweetcakes, a bit of sherry, and…
---
## &nbsp;
(sarcastically) Oh my! Aren’t you a delicate creature?
---
## &nbsp;
I'm sorry. Just a little…a…
---
## &nbsp;
Carry on.
---
## &nbsp;
Ah, no taste for wine, I see.
---
## JUSTINE:
It’s sour.
---
## MARIA:
A fine vintage. I promise.
---
## JUSTINE:
It looked like water. It wasn’t water.
---
## MARIA:
No, but it does help against the chill.
---
## JUSTINE:
What chill?
---
## MARIA:
The chill, I assume you must be feeling
---
## &nbsp;
dressed as you are.
---
## &nbsp;
That dress does does not seem
particularly substantial.
---
## JUSTINE:
I’m not cold.
---
## MARIA:
Truly?
---
## &nbsp;
All the same…
---
## &nbsp;
I think you’ll find it more comfortable.
---
## &nbsp;
Ah, ah, ah, ah!
---
## &nbsp;
Please, there is a room.
---
template: overlap
## MARIA:
Do your changing there.

## JUSTINE:
Don’t!
---
template: overlap
## MARIA:
I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to...

## JUSTINE:
Do not touch me.
---
## MARIA:
I meant nothing by it.
---
## JUSTINE:
If you mean me even a moment’s harm
---
## &nbsp;
you’ll not live long enough
to regret your error.
---
---
## MARIA:
Oh my God.
---
## &nbsp;
What have I gotten my self into?
---
---
## MARIA:
Better?
---
## &nbsp;
Here.
---
## &nbsp;
Why don’t I just...
---
## &nbsp;
Oh come now. You don’t need this rag.
---
## &nbsp;
Well, that was quite something.
---
## &nbsp;
Where did you get this?
---
## JUSTINE:
From the bookshelf.
---
## MARIA:
I mean this dress.
---
## JUSTINE:
I don’t remember a
time I did not have it.
---
## MARIA:
Interesting.
---
## &nbsp;
Mm mm.
---
## &nbsp;
Please sit.
---
## &nbsp;
I suppose I should start
by asking your name.
---
---
## &nbsp;
What is your name?
---
## &nbsp;
Do you not know it?
---
## JUSTINE:
No I do, only...
---
## &nbsp;
My mother used to sing to me.
---
## MARIA:
I beg your pardon?
---
## JUSTINE:
I remember her singing. No…not singing…a rhyme,
a children’s rhyme.
---
template: overlap
## JUSTINE:
“Home again, home
again,”…something about home…

## MARIA:
I see.
---
## JUSTINE:
“Jiggity jiggity jig”…
---
## &nbsp;
Justine.
---
## &nbsp;
I am Justine.
---
## MARIA:
Ha. Wonderbar! Justine…?
---
## JUSTINE:
Who are you?
---
## MARIA:
Ah. Of course.
---
## &nbsp;
You must be as perplexed as I am.
---
## &nbsp;
My name is Maria von Moos.
---
## &nbsp;
This is Salenegg Castle, my familial estate.
---
## JUSTINE:
Oh, you are rich.
---
## MARIA:
That’s maybe overstating it a bit.
---
## JUSTINE:
You have a castle.
---
## MARIA:
I _inherited_ a castle.
---
## &nbsp;
It is not quite the same thing.
---
## &nbsp;
Now if I may, what were
you doing in those ruins?
---
## JUSTINE:
Sleeping.
---
## MARIA:
Yes, clearly. When I
found you under the rubble
---
## &nbsp;
I nearly expired on the spot.
---
## &nbsp;
How on earth did you end
up beneath all that?
---
## JUSTINE:
I don’t remember.
---
## MARIA:
You may have experienced
some head trauma.
---
## &nbsp;
That would explain your memory.
---
## JUSTINE:
Back.
---
## MARIA:
I, I won’t hurt you.
---
## JUSTINE:
No, you won’t.
---
## MARIA:
But, your head.
---
## &nbsp;
You seem uninjured.
---
## &nbsp;
Except for these.
---
## &nbsp;
What happened to you?
---
## JUSTINE:
Don’t know.
---
## MARIA:
Those are some rather impressive scars.
---
## JUSTINE:
I have always had them.
---
## MARIA:
Always?
---
## JUSTINE:
As long as I can remember.
---
## MARIA:
May I take a look at them?
---
## &nbsp;
You are looking at them.
---
## MARIA:
Closer, I mean.
---
## &nbsp;
Ah.
---
## &nbsp;
Oh.
---
## &nbsp;
Oh my. These,
---
## &nbsp;
these are surgical scars.
---
## MARIA:
Very precise.
--

## JUSTINE:
Are you a doctor?
---
## MARIA:
Oh yes. Excepting an actual medical degree, of course.
---
## JUSTINE:
So you are not a doctor?
---
## MARIA:
Why quibble?
---
## &nbsp;
Intriguing.
---
## &nbsp;
They run perfectly along the joints.
---
## &nbsp;
Lucky for you, easy enough
to conceal beneath a dress.
---
## &nbsp;
Not as much these.
---
## &nbsp;
Heterochromia. Extremely rare.
---
## &nbsp;
Your eyes are two different colors.
---
## &nbsp;
Quite exotic, really.
---
## &nbsp;
My dear, you are altogether…fascinating.
---
## JUSTINE:
I’m not yours.
--

## MARIA:
What?
---
## JUSTINE:
I do not belong to you.
---
## MARIA:
I never said that you did.
---
## JUSTINE:
I don’t want to be here anymore.
---
## MARIA:
Truly?
---
## JUSTINE:
Let me go.
---
## MARIA:
I don’t think I could
stop you if I tried, but…
---
## &nbsp;
answer me this, Justine.
---
## &nbsp;
Should you leave this
place, where would you go?
---
## &nbsp;
I can help you. I can.
---
## JUSTINE:
I don’t,
---
## &nbsp;
I don’t like castles or doctors.
---
## MARIA:
You’ll like it far better than starving
---
## &nbsp;
or freezing in the streets.
---
## &nbsp;
You’ve been ill-used by this world.
---
## &nbsp;
I know what that means.
---
## &nbsp;
Here you will be safe from whatever,
---
## &nbsp;
whoever hurt you.
---
## &nbsp;
I can offer that much.
---
## JUSTINE:
I don’t trust you.
---
## MARIA:
Nor should you.
---
## &nbsp;
Trust must be earned.
---
## JUSTINE:
I don’t like you.
---
## MARIA:
Oh, now.
---
## &nbsp;
I think we both know that isn’t true.
---
## JUSTINE:
If you mean me any harm
just know I will kill you.
---
## MARIA:
Seems fair to me.
---

## JUSTINE:
Ah, you
filthy bloodsucking swine!
---
## MARIA:
Technically, swine don’t
actually suck blood, dear.
---
## JUSTINE:
Ah, that hurt.
---
## MARIA:
So I imagine the phrase “suckling pig”
---
## &nbsp;
would cause some confusion.
---
## &nbsp;
Hold that, please.
---
## JUSTINE:
You said it wouldn’t hurt.
---
## MARIA:
It’s the first lie they
teach in the academy, my dear.
---
## JUSTINE:
But I thought you were not a doctor.
---
## MARIA:
I may not hold the title
but I have the education.
---
## JUSTINE:
That seems odd.
---
## MARIA:
Yes, most think so.
---
## JUSTINE:
It is unusual for a
woman to be so learned?
---
## MARIA:
Oh, very.
---
## &nbsp;
But what is life without its
little peculiarities?
---
## JUSTINE:
I like that.
---
## MARIA:
I’ll have you know
---
## &nbsp;
I am the first woman to ever be inducted
---
## &nbsp;
into the Natural Research Society.
---
## &nbsp;
Also the _only_ woman, but…progress.
---
## JUSTINE:
I don’t know that is.
---
## MARIA:
Different circles, and whatnot.
---
## JUSTINE:
Your house looks like a forest.
---
## MARIA:
Hmm?
---
## &nbsp;
Ah, yes.
---
## &nbsp;
Of all of the sciences,
Botany is my favorite.
---
## &nbsp;
It’s a study of plants.
---
## JUSTINE:
So take their blood and leave me mine.
---
## MARIA:
Plants don’t actually have blood, lamb.
---
## &nbsp;
And since I have let you into my care,
---
## &nbsp;
let’s just be certain you
don’t have anything…communicable, hmm?
---
## &nbsp;
There.
---
## &nbsp;
Clotted fast. Good.
---
## JUSTINE:
I feel well.
---
## MARIA:
And I will examine your
blood to verify that.
---
## JUSTINE:
_Davallia Solida_, also known as the “Hare’s Foot Fern”.
---
## &nbsp;
It grows in Australia. So
you must’ve had it imported.
---
## &nbsp;
Thrives in colder climate
---
## &nbsp;
and can survive without constant tending.
---
## MARIA:
And just how did you know that?
---
## &nbsp;
You read this book?
---
## JUSTINE:
I read all of them.
---
## MARIA:
In one night?
--

## JUSTINE:
Yes.
---
## MARIA:
That’s impossible.
--

## JUSTINE:
Clearly it isn’t.
---
## MARIA:
And you retained what you read?
---
## JUSTINE:
This is why one reads. Isn’t it?
---
## MARIA:
Yes, of course. But…
---
## &nbsp;
_all_ of them, every one?
---
## JUSTINE:
That’s what I said.
---
## MARIA:
And you remember what you read?
---
## JUSTINE:
I don’t know how to make that clearer.
---
## MARIA:
Which book is this?
---
## JUSTINE:
_A System of Logic_ by
John Stuart Mill.
---
## MARIA:
You read this book cover to cover?
---
## JUSTINE:
I already said that.
---
## MARIA:
He is the father of inductive reasoning.
---
## &nbsp;
He created the five methods
for categorizing causation.
---
## JUSTINE:
Yes. “Mill’s Methods”.
---
## MARIA:
Mm hm. Which is the Fifth Method?
---
## JUSTINE:
“The Method of Concomitant Variations”.
---
## MARIA:
And what does it say?
---
## JUSTINE:
“Any phenomenon that varies in any manner
---
## &nbsp;
whenever another phenomenon varies
---
## &nbsp;
in some particular manner,
---
## &nbsp;
is either the cause or the
effect of that phenomenon,
---
## &nbsp;
or is connected with it through some fact of causation.”
---
## MARIA:
That was verbatim.
---
## JUSTINE:
You asked.
---
## MARIA:
Justine. You have perfect recall.
---
## &nbsp;
When you read something
you remember it completely
---
## &nbsp;
and permanently, don’t you?
---
## JUSTINE:
Yes. Do you not?
---
## MARIA:
I absolutely do not.
---
## &nbsp;
Why do you think I spent five years in academy?
---
## JUSTINE:
Food and shelter?
---
## MARIA:
Dear, you have a skill which
is rare in the extreme.
---
## &nbsp;
I was right to call you fascinating.
---
## JUSTINE:
I was…
---
## &nbsp;
*well made*.
---
## MARIA:
God! I would love to set you loose on the powdered wigs at Neuchatel!
---
## &nbsp;
See them speak on the
inferiority of women then!
---
## JUSTINE:
I am inferior to none.
---
## MARIA:
I am becoming convinced of that.
---
## JUSTINE:
Why would they assume that I am?
---
## MARIA:
That is a very large 
thing you have just asked.
---
## &nbsp;
A question I have spent my
life trying to answer.
---
## JUSTINE:
Have you?
---
## MARIA:
In my experience I have
learned that one can ask why
---
## &nbsp;
something is as it is,
or one may change it.
---
## &nbsp;
Rarely is there time for both.
---
## JUSTINE:
This is why you dress like a man?
---
## MARIA:
I dress as I dress
because it is comfortable.
---
## JUSTINE:
This is why you study the sciences?
---
## MARIA:
I study the natural world
---
## &nbsp;
because I’ve always been
deeply curious about it.
---
## &nbsp;
I was fortunate to be born to a position
---
## &nbsp;
that allowed for study.
---
## &nbsp;
My father tried to marry
me off a few times, but…
---
## &nbsp;
I had ways of making myself
an undesirable helpmate.
---
## JUSTINE:
Yes. I was meant for another as well.
--

## MARIA:
Oh yes?
---
## JUSTINE:
Yes. We met only once, he and I.
---
## &nbsp;
We were…a poor match.
---
## MARIA:
To poor matches.
---
## JUSTINE:
You don’t have a glass.
---
## MARIA:
Symbolic, my dear.
--

## JUSTINE:
Ah.
---
## MARIA:
So this match was set by your father?
---
## JUSTINE:
He was like my father, I suppose, or
---
## &nbsp;
like a friend, I can’t...
---
## &nbsp;
My past is…pieces are missing.
---
## &nbsp;
A scattered puzzle.
---
## MARIA:
I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to…
--

## JUSTINE:
I remember him.
---
## &nbsp;
I remember my intended.
---
## &nbsp;
Our first meeting and our
last. One and the same.
---
## &nbsp;
Violence, lightning, walls
shattering into flame.
---
## &nbsp;
His face.
---
## &nbsp;
My mate’s face.
---
## &nbsp;
Scared and malformed.
---
## &nbsp;
I had a life before that day, but
---
## &nbsp;
it eludes me. I see it in
---
## &nbsp;
flashes of light, and then they go dark.
---
## MARIA:
That trauma you have suffered,
---
## &nbsp;
your mind is trying to
protect you from it.
---
## JUSTINE:
I have suffered trauma, then?
---
## MARIA:
The story you just told,
the scars on your body,
---
## &nbsp;
I should say it’s very likely. Yes.
---
## JUSTINE:
Perhaps I am better
for not remembering.
---
## MARIA:
Don’t you want to know who you are?
---
## JUSTINE:
I am Justine.
---
## &nbsp;
I am here. I am alive.
---
## &nbsp;
That is enough. 
---
## MARIA:
I cannot help but think
---
## &nbsp;
you are something much more than that.
---
## &nbsp;
Would you like something to eat?
---
## &nbsp;
I am afraid circumstances
have robbed me of my servants,
---
## &nbsp;
but I do keep the larder stocked.
---
## &nbsp;
I have clothes for you,
---
## &nbsp;
though mostly of a masculine cut.
---
## JUSTINE:
What of my dress?
---
## MARIA:
Those tatters?
---
## &nbsp;
Best to see them burned and buried.
---
## &nbsp;
Where did you find that antique?
---
## JUSTINE:
I don’t know.
---
## MARIA:
It looked like something my
great-grandmother would’ve worn.
---
## JUSTINE:
Is this to be my home?
This castle of yours.
---
## MARIA:
For now.
---
## &nbsp;
As to the future, who could say?
---
## JUSTINE:
If I wish to leave, I will leave.
---
## MARIA:
Of course you will.
---
## JUSTINE:
You cannot stop me.
---
## MARIA:
Oh. I think that has
been well established.
---
## &nbsp;
You are working awfully hard
to avoid saying “thank you”.
---
## JUSTINE:
You are a stranger to me.
---
## MARIA:
I’m less a stranger this
passing of every hour.
---
## JUSTINE:
I could do you great harm.
---
## MARIA:
What can’t do me great harm?
---
## &nbsp;
A slip and a fall
could do me great harm.
---
## &nbsp;
Speaking my mind in the wrong company
---
## &nbsp;
could do me great harm.
---
## &nbsp;
And yes…I am certain you
could do me _very_ great harm.
---
## &nbsp;
But I don’t think you will.
---
## JUSTINE:
Why?
---
## MARIA:
Because you’re very bright.
---
## &nbsp;
And a bright woman knows
---
## &nbsp;
a good situation when
she stumbles upon it.
---
## &nbsp;
I shall return for luncheon.
---
## &nbsp;
In the meantime, enjoy the
library and the grounds…
---
## JUSTINE:
Where are you going?
---
## MARIA:
Well, I have to test your blood.
---
## &nbsp;
And I have my have my own studies to resume.
---
## JUSTINE:
The books.
---
## &nbsp;
The books you stole when
you found me in the ruins.
--

## MARIA:
Stole? Nonsense.
---
## MARIA:
It’s called “excavating”.
---
## JUSTINE:
They were your goal. I was simply…
--

## MARIA:
An unexpected find.
---
## MARIA:
In truth I thought you
were well and truly dead
---
## &nbsp;
when I found you beneath that table.
---
## &nbsp;
Sound asleep.
---
## &nbsp;
Blue as a frozen lake.
---
## &nbsp;
Yet here you are, rosy-cheeked and strong as ox.
---
## JUSTINE:
I am well made.
---
## MARIA:
I am still not entirely
certain what that means…
---
## &nbsp;
But yes, I am something of a book-hunter.
---
## &nbsp;
I had heard tales of the scientist
---
## &nbsp;
who once resided there, and hoped I might…
---
## &nbsp;
add to my collection.
---
## JUSTINE:
You are not a doctor…you are a scientist.
--

## MARIA:
Yes.
---
## JUSTINE:
A scientist of plants.
--

## MARIA:
No. I am fascinated by plants,
---
## &nbsp;
and I hope they will
lead me to what I seek.
---
## &nbsp;
But they’re a means to an end.
---
## JUSTINE:
What is it you seek?
---
## MARIA:
With any luck, the tomes I retrieved
---
## &nbsp;
will provide illumination to that.
---
## JUSTINE:
I would not be so quick
to trust those books.
--

## MARIA:
Why?
---
## JUSTINE:
I knew…
---
## &nbsp;
I think I knew the man who wrote them.
---
## &nbsp;
A doctor and a scientist. 
---
## &nbsp;
I can see his face.
---
## MARIA:
What?
---
## JUSTINE:
Yes. A young man…
---
## &nbsp;
A madman. His madness
lead him to create horrors.
---
## MARIA:
That’s not possible.
---
## JUSTINE:
No I, I remember.
---
## &nbsp;
He’s the one, the father
who is not my father.
---
## MARIA:
Justine, calm your yourself.
---
## MARIA:
I think your mind is
playing tricks on you.
--

## JUSTINE:
No.
---
## MARIA:
Creating false memories from stories
you heard as a child.
---
## JUSTINE:
No, no! It’s true!
---
## &nbsp;
The castle. The one in which you found me.
---
## &nbsp;
I think I...Yes, yes.
I was a servant there.
---
## JUSTINE:
I was his servant!
--

## MARIA:
Justine, calm down.
---
## JUSTINE:
I could almost...
---
## &nbsp;
my mother and I, we…we
lived there together!
---
## &nbsp;
And the Master, he took care of us until…
---
## &nbsp;
What happened? I…I did
something. I did something.
---
## MARIA:
Justine. *Stop*.
---
## &nbsp;
I think you may be mixing
fantasy with the truth.
---
## &nbsp;
There is no possible way you lived there.
---
## &nbsp;
Or worked there…
---
## JUSTINE:
I did!
---
## &nbsp;
I know I did! Why won’t you believe me?
---
## MARIA:
Because no one has lived in that castle
---
## &nbsp;
for over one hundred years.
---
## &nbsp;
The Baron who owned it,
---
## &nbsp;
it is true he was a scientist, 
---
## &nbsp;
but he disappeared before I was even born.
---
## &nbsp;
They say his whole family was murdered
---
## &nbsp;
in the space of a night, and he vanished.
---
## &nbsp;
The villagers won’t go near the place
---
## &nbsp;
for fear of the evil they
think still haunts it.
---
## &nbsp;
To my knowledge,
---
## &nbsp;
I am the first person to
set foot there in a century.
---
## JUSTINE:
But, I don’t understand…it was my home.
--

## MARIA:
Justine.
---
## &nbsp;
What year do you think it is?
---
## JUSTINE:
1779.
---
## &nbsp;
1779! It has to be, I am 26 years old,
---
## &nbsp;
and I was born in 1753. It has to be!
---
## &nbsp;
What year is it?
---

## MARIA:
Stop.

## JUSTINE:
Tell me.
---
## MARIA:
1881.
---
## &nbsp;
It is 1881.
---
## JUSTINE:
But, how can this be?
---
## MARIA:
I don’t know.

---
## JANOS:
Dearest Maria.
---
## &nbsp;
How is my favorite of mountain flowers?
---
## &nbsp;
I hope you continue to bloom
---
## &nbsp;
in that decrepit old fortress of yours.
---
## &nbsp;
I know you’ve been rather hard off
---
## &nbsp;
these past years,
---
## &nbsp;
but a coat of paint
can truly work wonders.
---
## &nbsp;
Of course, I jest, because
I know how much you’ve missed
---
## &nbsp;
my particular sense of humor.
---
## &nbsp;
For truly, who makes you
laugh more than your beloved Janos?
---
## &nbsp;
I write with wonderful news.
---
## &nbsp;
My traveling troupe
and I shall be arriving
---
## &nbsp;
in Geneva tomorrow.
---
## &nbsp;
We shall be touring Switzerland this month
---
## &nbsp;
and I could not possibly pass
---
## &nbsp;
through your lovely lands
---
## &nbsp;
without paying you a visit.
---
## &nbsp;
You can expect me at dusk
or sometime thereabouts.
---
## &nbsp;
I also delight to tell you
---
## &nbsp;
that Italy treated us very well this year.
---
## &nbsp;
And I come to you with open
arms and overstuffed coffers.
---
## &nbsp;
I am quite curious to see
what you may have for me.
---
## &nbsp;
If you have items
---
## &nbsp;
of the same quality as two summers past,
---
## &nbsp;
I will gladly ease your
financial burden.
---
## &nbsp;
My days are dark until
I see your shining face,
---
## &nbsp;
_Janos_.

---
template: noise
driving ominous string music
---
---
## MARIA:
Ah. I was wondering where I put those.
---
## JUSTINE:
What have you learned?
---
## MARIA:
I have learned that I
should be more careful
---
## &nbsp;
with my debt notices.
---
## JUSTINE:
To the devil with these.
What have your tests shown?
---
## MARIA:
I…God help me. I don’t know.
---
## JUSTINE:
What does that mean?
---
## &nbsp;
I cannot sit!! I…
---
## MARIA:
Please. I have been looking through
lenses all day and my head
---
## &nbsp;
is fit to burst.
---
## MARIA:
I am somewhat confounded.
--

## JUSTINE:
Why?
---
## MARIA:
Your blood, it is far from normal.
---
## &nbsp;
Or rather, at a glance it appears normal,
---
## &nbsp;
normal viscosity, normal color but…
---
## &nbsp;
under greater scrutiny…
---
## &nbsp;
Ah yes. I almost forgot this was here.
---
## &nbsp;
Don’t let the dust worry you.
---
## &nbsp;
Justine. There is a substance in your blood
---
## &nbsp;
which defies description.
---
## &nbsp;
I’ve run every test I could think of,
---
## &nbsp;
and even invented a few as I went,
---
## &nbsp;
but I am still at a total loss.
---
## JUSTINE:
How did it get there?
---
## &nbsp;
Was I drugged?
---
## MARIA:
No. It actually appears
to be produced by your body.
---
## &nbsp;
Don’t ask me how, but…
---
## JUSTINE:
Am I in danger?
---
## MARIA:
Far from it.
---
## &nbsp;
In fact, I think it may explain
---
## &nbsp;
your rather bizarre conundrum.
---
## &nbsp;
To the best of my understanding, the substance serves as something of
---
## &nbsp;
an organic preservative.
---
## &nbsp;
The natural decay a
body undergoes over time
---
## &nbsp;
is drastically slowed in your body.
---
## &nbsp;
You recuperate quickly,
---
## &nbsp;
your strength and endurance are enhanced
---
## &nbsp;
and whatever happened in that old keep,
---
## &nbsp;
whatever trapped you in that
dungeon where I found you…
---
## &nbsp;
at some point your body went
into some sort of hibernation.
---
## &nbsp;
Unable to free yourself
or find sustenance,
---
## &nbsp;
you simply went to sleep.
---
## &nbsp;
Your astonishing physiology
---
## &nbsp;
slowed to the smallest possible fraction, and kept you that way until…
---
## &nbsp;
…well, until someone
found you and woke you up.
---
## JUSTINE:
Like in children’s story.
---
## MARIA:
That ravenous hunger you felt at first…
---
## &nbsp;
your awakening restarted
all your essential systems
---
## &nbsp;
and those systems demanded fuel.
---
## MARIA:
Have you felt any hunger since the?
--

## JUSTINE:
No.
---
## MARIA:
Ah. I suspect your
physiological systems,
---
## &nbsp;
respiratory, neurological, digestive,
---
## &nbsp;
all of them are
functioning at a level
---
## &nbsp;
that medical science never dreamed possible.
---
## &nbsp;
How fast you heal,
---
## &nbsp;
how fast you learn! My God. Justine.
---
## &nbsp;
You are miracle made flesh.
---
## JUSTINE:
You learned all this
from a blood sample?
---
## MARIA:
No. That was only the beginning.
---
## &nbsp;
The true answers were here.
---
## JUSTINE:
What is that?
---
## MARIA:
The scientist…
---
## &nbsp;
your father, who was not your father,
---
## &nbsp;
this is his journal.
---
## &nbsp;
And in it,
---
## &nbsp;
the world,
---
## &nbsp;
the world is changed forever
by what he put in this.
---
## JUSTINE:
Tell me.
---
## MARIA:
Justine. I need you to be certain.
---
## &nbsp;
The secrets contained
here will give you answers
---
## &nbsp;
but, well, as Solomon said,
---
## &nbsp;
“In much wisdom is much grief,”
---
## &nbsp;
“and he who increases
knowledge increases sorrow.”
---
## JUSTINE:
I need to know.
---
## MARIA:
That thing you say…“I was well made”.
---
## &nbsp;
Why do you say that?
---
## JUSTINE:
I am uncertain.
---
## &nbsp;
A memory, a voice, I hear it in my mind.
---
## &nbsp;
“You are well made.”
---
## MARIA:
Yes. I believe I know
where that voice came from.
---
## &nbsp;
Justine, you did not come into
this world as a normal child.
---
## &nbsp;
Or rather, you did at one point.
---
## &nbsp;
But where most of us are born, live, and die,
---
## &nbsp;
you experienced a fourth stage…rebirth.
---
## JUSTINE:
What is this?
---
## MARIA:
A diagram. Instructions.
---
## JUSTINE:
For what?
---
## MARIA:
For creating a living being
from the parts of others.
---
## &nbsp;
You were lucky, in point of fact.
---
## &nbsp;
You were not the doctor’s first attempt
---
## &nbsp;
but his second.
---
## &nbsp;
He learned much from his first creation,
---
## &nbsp;
which was apparently hideous to behold.
---
## &nbsp;
You were created with
much greater elegance,
---
## &nbsp;
delicacy and skill.
---
## JUSTINE:
Good Christ.
---
## MARIA:
What you remembered…
you were meant to be
---
## &nbsp;
the mate for his first creation.
---
## &nbsp;
The doctor created you primarily from
---
## &nbsp;
the body of a servant who had died young.
---
## &nbsp;
Those memories you have…
---
## &nbsp;
Justine’s memories…
---
## &nbsp;
they are well and truly yours.
---
## &nbsp;
I believe more may come back in time
---
## &nbsp;
but these are uncharted waters, lamb.
---
## JUSTINE:
This is what I am?
---
## &nbsp;
A construct, a bride made of
---
## &nbsp;
chemicals and stitches and dead flesh?
---
## MARIA:
You heard what I said? A miracle.
---
## &nbsp;
A future of unrivaled
promise in a perfect body.
---
## JUSTINE:
Perfect?
---
## &nbsp;
This is not perfection!
---
## &nbsp;
Nor this, or this.
---
## &nbsp;
And these eyes…which
are my own true ones?
---
## &nbsp;
The brown or the blue?
---
## &nbsp;
I do not even remember.
---
## &nbsp;
There is no promise here, 
only some unnatural thing!
---
## MARIA:
If I may, that is a very
narrow way to look at this.
---
## JUSTINE:
What?
---
## MARIA:
Your first life, the
life you barely recall.
---
## &nbsp;
What was it?
---
## &nbsp;
A poor servant with no future
beyond scrubbing floors
---
## &nbsp;
and birthing child after child?
---
## &nbsp;
And assuming you did
not die of childbirth
---
## &nbsp;
you may have been lived
enough to contract cholera
---
## &nbsp;
or consumption, or any number of ailments
---
## &nbsp;
which will now _never_ afflict you.
---
## &nbsp;
You have a mind sharper than any scholar.
---
## &nbsp;
A body which has endured
over one hundred years
---
## &nbsp;
without so much of a
_gray hair_ to show for it.
---
## &nbsp;
And the cost for this is what, some scars?
---
## &nbsp;
And forgetting a life
---
## &nbsp;
which likely was not worth
remembering to begin with?
---
## &nbsp;
Ah. My God.
---
## &nbsp;
I would sell my immortal soul for
a fraction of what you have.
---
## &nbsp;
You think yourself unnatural?
---
## &nbsp;
I have studied nature all my life.
---
## &nbsp;
It is viciousness and
sickness and rot.
---
## &nbsp;
Everything I have worked
on in these past years
---
## &nbsp;
has been to fix this
flawed and broken machine
---
## &nbsp;
we call nature,
---
## &nbsp;
to perfect the imperfect designs so that…
---
## &nbsp;
Justine.
---
## &nbsp;
In these books of formulae and theory
---
## &nbsp;
that most would consider utter lunacy.
---
## &nbsp;
So help me, *I* would have
thought them lunacy.
---
## &nbsp;
But here you are
---
## &nbsp;
standing before me.
---
## &nbsp;
The future in all your glory.
---
## JUSTINE:
You think I am the future?
---
## MARIA:
I pray you are.
---
## &nbsp;
Because if you are
---
## &nbsp;
then perhaps humanity
is not a doomed species.
---
## JUSTINE:
But that’s just it, I’m not human.
---
## MARIA:
Why don’t we keep
that our little secret?
---
## JUSTINE:
If I am not truly Justine
---
## &nbsp;
or any of the parts
that were added to her,
---
## &nbsp;
then I can be anything I want.
---
## MARIA:
Yes.
---
## JUSTINE:
I feel like that should
terrify me, but it doesn’t.
---
## MARIA:
Because you have a choice.
---
## &nbsp;
A true choice. That is a
rare and beautiful thing.
---
## &nbsp;
With your strength of mind and body
---
## &nbsp;
you cannot be held down
---
## &nbsp;
by the shackles the world puts on us.
---
## JUSTINE:
I think I understand.
---
## &nbsp;
You should be a doctor, yet you are not
---
## &nbsp;
and it is because you are a woman, yes?
---
## MARIA:
Yes.
---
## JUSTINE:
And I,
---
## &nbsp;
and I was created to be
a bride and nothing else.
---
## &nbsp;
But, my father and my intended
are now both long dead
---
## &nbsp;
while I still live.
---
## MARIA:
Yes.
---
## JUSTINE:
Teach me.
---
## MARIA:
Sorry?
---
## JUSTINE:
Teach me
---
## &nbsp;
what to do with this life,
---
## &nbsp;
with these abilities I possess.
---
## MARIA:
I’m still not entirely
certain what you are capable of.
---
## JUSTINE:
Let us learn together.
---
## MARIA:
But I do have my own studies to resume.
---
## JUSTINE:
These are what you are
studying, yes, these journals?
---
## MARIA:
I am.
---
## JUSTINE:
Am I not the work that they
contain made flesh and blood?
---
## &nbsp;
Don’t you see?
---
## &nbsp;
You were meant to find me just
as I was meant to help you
---
## &nbsp;
with your work.
---
## MARIA:
I am, I don’t...
---
## JANOS:
There you are, petal!
---
## &nbsp;
I knocked for five long minutes
---
## &nbsp;
before I remembered your
servants were…oh.

## &nbsp;
Well I seem to be late to this wee fete.

## &nbsp;
Oh. Well hello there, lovely!

You really should check
your mail more regularly.

You wrote to me yesterday

## &nbsp;
to inform me you will arrive today?

## JANOS:
Surprise.

## MARIA:
God, you’re a fool.

## &nbsp;
A little more warning next time.

## JANOS:
Now that I know you have a
watchdog you may count on it.
---
## MARIA:
Ah. Yes. Janos,
---
## &nbsp;
this is my friend Justine.
---
## &nbsp;
Justine, this is...
---
## JANOS:
Janos Vystario, my dear!
---
## &nbsp;
Master showman and proprietor of
---
## &nbsp;
Vystario’s Menagerie of the Macabre.
---
## &nbsp;
And may I say, you quite
literally take my breath away.
---
## &nbsp;
Too formal?
---
## &nbsp;
Do we hug? 
---
## &nbsp;
We do not hug.
---
## MARIA:
Janos is an old friend of mine.
---
## JANOS:
“Old friend”, she says. Must you be so clinical?
---
## &nbsp;
Dear Maria and I have known each other
---
## &nbsp;
for over 10 years.
---
## &nbsp;
How many times have I proposed to you?
---
## MARIA:
Just the three.
---
## JANOS:
Do not doubt there will be a fourth.
---
## JUSTINE:
One might presume that having
been rebuffed three times,
---
## &nbsp;
that the lady has made her intentions—
---
## &nbsp;
or lack thereof—very clear.
---
## JANOS:
Well, well, well.
---
## &nbsp;
You’ve a wit, lass, if not a poet’s soul.
---
## &nbsp;
So tell me Maria, where
did you find this charmer?
---
## MARIA:
We are recently acquainted.
---
## &nbsp;
She is assisting me with my research.
---
## JANOS:
Oh Lord. Of course.
---
## &nbsp;
Another girl playing
with daddy’s test tubes.
---
## &nbsp;
You’ll never fetch a husband that way.
---
## &nbsp;
A jest, you rude thing, a jest!
---
## &nbsp;
My, but you are dour!
---
## &nbsp;
I may not understand your fascination with
---
## &nbsp;
scalpels and chemicals,
---
## &nbsp;
but old Janos knows a
changing wind when he feels it.
---
## &nbsp;
Maria can attest to that, yes?
---
## MARIA:
Janos is a boor, but
he’s a harmless boor.
---
## JANOS:
Never have I heard so
ringing an endorsement.
---
## &nbsp;
Now ladies, have we supped?
---
## &nbsp;
I for one am wasting away!
---
## &nbsp;
Let us off to the kitchen
---
## &nbsp;
and see if I can concoct something
edible from your scraps!
---
## JUSTINE:
For a showman…
--

## JANOS:
_Master_ showman.
---
## JUSTINE:
Your sense of timing is dreadful.
---
## &nbsp;
Maria and I have work to do.
---
## JANOS:
And, once I’ve et, bathed
and been shown to my room,
---
## &nbsp;
I will gladly leave you to it.
---
## &nbsp;
What says the lady of the castle? Hm?
---
## MARIA:
To my great regret,
---
## &nbsp;
I believe I once said
you were always welcome at Salenegg.
---
## JANOS:
Just so.
---
## MARIA:
And I am nothing if
not a woman of my word.
---
## JANOS:
Then it is settled. To the feast,
---
## &nbsp;
where we shall drink wine
---
## &nbsp;
and get to know each other better!
---
## JUSTINE:
You will die an old man before
I take that arm, Vystario.
---
## JANOS: 
Oh. I’ll win you over yet.
---

---
## JUSTINE:
Not sure I understand.
---
## JANOS:
What’s not to understand?
---
## &nbsp;
I tour Europe with a small
troupe, really only a handful, and…
---
## JUSTINE:
I know what a troupe is.
---
## &nbsp;
But people are entertained by this?
---
## JANOS:
We are living in an age of marvels, my dear.
---
## JUSTINE:
Don’t call me that.
---
## JANOS:
While cities like Geneva and Rome and London are the home of scientific advancement,
---
## &nbsp;
Most in these country villages never get to see such sights.
---
## JUSTINE:
You manage a freak show.
---
## JANOS:
Such a vulgar term.
---
## &nbsp;
Vystario’s Menagerie of the Macabre is a cavalcade of medical curiosities!
---
## MARIA:
Let us speak of something else.
---
## JANOS:
In fact, most of my
exhibits aren’t even alive.
---
## &nbsp;
There’s the two-headed cow,
my dwarf, my pinhead…
---
## &nbsp;
but everything else is dead.
---
## &nbsp;
And meticulously preserved.
---
## MARIA:
Or is a fraud made of
chicken wire and plaster.
---
## JANOS:
Oh. My mountain flower has thorns!
---
## &nbsp;
Would the great Vystario commit such chicanery?

And what is your role in this?

is not romantic in nature.

template: overlap
## MARIA:
Oh, dear God, no…

## JANOS:
She should be so lucky.
---
## MARIA:
It’s not really something...
--

## JANOS:
Have you not guessed?
---
## &nbsp;
Where do you think a Master
Showman procures his exhibits?
---
## MARIA:
It is not what you think.
---
## JANOS:
Oh. We’re not buying and
selling living beings, Justine.
---
## &nbsp;
But over the course of
her research and whatnot,
---
## &nbsp;
Maria has on occasion come into possession
---
## &nbsp;
of certain *abnormalities*.
---
## &nbsp;
Put said beasties into a jar of formaldehyde and
---
## &nbsp;
the peasants flock to see them.
---
## &nbsp;
Oh I pay a pretty penny for them, but...
---
## MARIA:
Reggie! That is quite enough!
---
## JUSTINE:
Reggie?
---
## JANOS:
(in a different accent)<br>
Well, I suppose that little secret’s out.
---
## &nbsp;
I’m afraid “Janos Vystario”
is but a stage name.
---
## &nbsp;
I was born Reggie Cobb of Sussex, England.
---
## &nbsp;
But really, could you see
that name on a red banner?
---
## &nbsp;
“Janos Vystario” has so much
foreign allure, wouldn’t you agree?
---
## &nbsp;
And hard to pin down exactly where it came from.
---
## &nbsp;
Do promise not to tell.
---
## JUSTINE:
Oh. My social circle is very small.
---
## JANOS:
I find that hard to believe.
---
## &nbsp;
For all your brusqueness, you’re
really quite captivating.
---
## &nbsp;
Perhaps it’s those eyes.
---
## &nbsp;
Never seen anything quite like that.
---
## JUSTINE:
I am not an exhibit, Mr. Vystario.
---
## JANOS:
(showman accent)<br>
Of course not! You’re
all together too…normal.
---
## &nbsp;
But if you ever grow a third eye or a furry pelt, do seek me out.
---
## &nbsp;
I pay very well.
---
## JUSTINE:
That day will never come.
---
## JANOS:
Just as well,
---
## &nbsp;
you don’t have the
temperament for show business.
---
## JUSTINE:
Do you not hear the
mistake you keep making?
---
## JANOS:
I’m not sure I do.
---
## JUSTINE:
You keep speaking as though you know me.
---
## &nbsp;
You do not know me, little
man, and you are safer for it.
---
## MARIA:
Justine. There
is no need for threats.
---
## JANOS:
Good Christ…
--

## JUSTINE:
I am simply making a point.
---
## JANOS:
What happened to you, girl?
---
## JANOS:
The scar along your…does that go all the way around your neck?
--

## JUSTINE:
Yes.
---
## MARIA:
Justine!
---
## JUSTINE:
I will not be ashamed of them, Maria.
---
## &nbsp;
I am the future. Remember?
---
## &nbsp;
You see? I have endured
more than you can imagine

## &nbsp;
and still here I stand.
---
## JANOS:
How many scars do you have?
---
## JUSTINE:
More than you realize.
---
## &nbsp;
This man wearies me.
---
## &nbsp;
I am returning to my chamber.
---
## &nbsp;
Maria, we can resume
our work in the morning.
---
## JANOS:
I didn’t mean to offend.
---
## JUSTINE:
And yet you offended all the same.
---
## &nbsp;
Well done.
---
## JANOS:
What is this creature
you invited into your home?
---
## MARIA:
Yes. He can be a vulgar swine, 
---
## &nbsp;
but I’ve known him for many years.
---
## JANOS:
Aren’t you droll?
---
## MARIA:
When it suits me.
---
## JANOS:
That girl...
---
## MARIA:
Something more than you can imagine.
---
## JANOS:
Did you see those scars?
---
## &nbsp;
She looks like a ragdoll come to life.
---
## MARIA:
Don’t be unkind.
---
## JANOS:
Unkind? I’m worried about you, Maria.
---
## MARIA:
There’s no need.
---
## JANOS:
She would have been a
threat to you on your best day, petal.
---
## &nbsp;
And forgive me, but
---
## &nbsp;
I know your best days are past you now.
---
## &nbsp;
May I ask,
---
## &nbsp;
how bad it is?
---
## MARIA:
It progresses apace.
---
## JANOS:
I’m sorry. Truly.
---
## MARIA:
I understand your concern,
---
## &nbsp;
but my research may be yielding
rather interesting results.
---
## JANOS:
Oh yes? 
---
## MARIA:
I don’t want to
jump to any conclusions.
---
## JANOS:
I’m glad to hear it Maria.
---
## MARIA:
I have come across some materials
---
## &nbsp;
that have given me
---
## &nbsp;
an entirely new
perspective on this matter.
---
## JANOS:
And that brute of an
assistant is helping you?
---
## MARIA:
She is invaluable to the research.
---
## JANOS:
Far be it for this simple thespian
---
## &nbsp;
to question your scientific methods.
---
## &nbsp;
Are the vultures still circling?
---
## MARIA:
Oh. God. Yes.
---
## &nbsp;
Between my father’s gambling
and my own circumstances…
---
## JANOS:
You could sell the place.
---
## MARIA:
Oh. Let us not discuss this again.
---
## JANOS:
At some point you must consider it.
---
## MARIA:
This is not that point.
---
## JANOS:
Perhaps. But I think it’s soon to come.
---
## MARIA:
You could forestall it with a loan?
---
## JANOS:
Love, I am on occasion kind,
---
## &nbsp;
but I am never charitable.
---
## &nbsp;
Giving is how one goes out of business.
---
## &nbsp;
Now _buying_ on the other hand…
---
## MARIA:
I’m afraid I have found nothing that
would be of interest to you.
---
## JANOS:
Damn.
---
## MARIA:
If I had, I would have
written you immediately.
---
## &nbsp;
I’m afraid my situation has dictated that
---
## &nbsp;
my research shifts away from cataloging the…
---
## &nbsp;
medically unfortunate.
---
## JANOS:
God, remember that boy?
--

## MARIA:
Which one?
---
## JANOS:
The one with the malformed skull,
---
## &nbsp;
looked like he was growing horns.
---
## MARIA:
Yes.
---
## &nbsp;
Sad thing, nothing to be done for him.
---
## JANOS:
Well. Perhaps not “nothing”.
---
## MARIA:
Oh please. You know I don’t like to talk about it.
---
## JANOS:
Of course. Forgive me.
---
## &nbsp;
I call his skeleton “The Devil’s Imp”.
---
## &nbsp;
You should see people flock to it.
--

## MARIA:
Reggie!
---
## JANOS:
The audiences do love a good deformity.
---
## MARIA:
I’ve told you, I have nothing for you.
---
## JANOS:
Are you truly sure about that?
---
## MARIA:
What are you talking about?
---
## JANOS:
Oh. Come now. I think you know.
--

## MARIA:
I don’t.
---
## JANOS:
Tell me.
---
## &nbsp;
Have you examined her thoroughly?
---
## JANOS:
How many scars in total?
--

## MARIA:
No.
---
## JANOS:
Oh. I can already imagine the poster.
---
## &nbsp;
Put her in something revealing enough
---
## &nbsp;
so that every incision is plain to see.
---
## &nbsp;
A little scandalous, a little frightening.
---
## MARIA:
Listen to me, you vile man.
---
## &nbsp;
I have done business with you in the past
---
## &nbsp;
to save my own hide
---
## &nbsp;
and I have lost sleep over
every deal we’ve made.
---
## &nbsp;
But God. There has to be a limit, Reg.
---
## &nbsp;
A line that can’t be crossed.
---
## &nbsp;
This is it.
---
## JANOS:
A line?
---
## &nbsp;
Those hardly sound like the
words of a scientist, Maria.
---
## &nbsp;
What? Are you afraid one more sin
---
## &nbsp;
will cost you your immortal soul?
---
## &nbsp;
I thought you put never
stock in such things.
---
## MARIA:
My perception of the
universe has broadened of late.
---
## JANOS:
You have no idea how sad
it makes me to hear that.
---
## &nbsp;
Because Italy was good to me this year.
---
## &nbsp;
Very good. You should’ve seen the people
---
## &nbsp;
lining up to marvel at my exhibits.
---
## &nbsp;
I’m already planning my return.
---
## &nbsp;
I have one thousand lira
in my valise right now.
---
## &nbsp;
One. Thousand.
---
## MARIA:
I’m sure they told
Judas something similar.
---
## JANOS:
It would solve so, so many problems, petal.
---
## MARIA:
You want her so badly, Reg?
---
## &nbsp;
Why don’t you go ahead
and try to take her?
---
## &nbsp;
I would dearly love to see
how that might turn out.
---
## JANOS:
Thank you. No. I enjoy my
genitalia right where they are.
---
## &nbsp;
But I know you.
---
## &nbsp;
You’ve brewed up so many
concoctions with your wee plants.
---
## &nbsp;
Perhaps something to
make her more docile?
---
## MARIA:
Docility is not her nature.
---
## &nbsp;
I think I would like
you to leave tomorrow.
--

## JANOS:
Maria.
---
## MARIA:
Oh. You are welcome stay the night.
---
## &nbsp;
And I will even give you some
breakfast in the morning.
---
## &nbsp;
But after that, let’s
see that wagon of yours
---
## &nbsp;
cresting those hills, hmm?
---
## JANOS:
Let’s not get prickly.
---
## &nbsp;
We’ve had a good understanding
these many years.
---
## &nbsp;
No need to sour it.
---
## MARIA:
Oh. I think there’s every need.
---
## JANOS:
You’re breaking my heart, petal.
---
## MARIA:
Where your heart should be
there is only a coin purse.
---
## &nbsp;
Trust me, I am a doctor.
---
## JANOS:
Funny. I thought you never
quite earned that title.
---
## MARIA:
Go. Now.
--

## JANOS:
Of course, of course.
---
## &nbsp;
Should you need me I’ll be at
the berghotel down the road.
---
## JANOS:
Just drop me a note.
--

## MARIA:
Out!
---
## &nbsp;
One. Thousand.
---
template: noise
pensive plucky strings
---
---
## MARIA:
And, here it is.
---
## &nbsp;
I will just assume that is stunned silence.
---
## JUSTINE:
I don’t like it.
---
## MARIA:
Why?
---
## JUSTINE:
It reminds me of
something, something bad.
---
## MARIA:
It’s a laboratory.
---
## &nbsp;
They’re neither good nor bad.
---
## &nbsp;
And what is a doctor without a laboratory?
---
## JUSTINE:
You are not a doctor.
---
## MARIA:
Why must everyone remind me of that?
---
## JUSTINE:
Are these all from me?
---
## MARIA:
Yes.
---
## &nbsp;
They are proving
invaluable to my research.
---
---
## MARIA:
Yes?
---
## JUSTINE:
You are moving slowly.
---
## MARIA:
Yes. Well. That happens.
---
## JUSTINE:
You were carousing with Janos.
---
## MARIA:
That is not the reason.
---
## JUSTINE:
I think it is.
---
## MARIA:
I sent that guttersnipe packing.
---
## &nbsp;
Try to hold back your tears.
---
## JUSTINE:
He is your friend
---
## &nbsp;
yet you do not seem to enjoy his company.
---
## MARIA:
I am not certain I would
call him my *friend* but, well,
---
## &nbsp;
sometimes we endure the
company of those we hate
---
## &nbsp;
for the sake of what we want.
---
## JUSTINE:
What do you want?
---
## MARIA:
What everyone wants, I imagine.
---
---
## JUSTINE:
What was that?
---
## MARIA:
A brew of my own making.
---
## &nbsp;
I am afraid this castle
isn’t the only thing
---
## &nbsp;
I inherited from my father.
---
## &nbsp;
He was younger than me when he died of it.
---
## JUSTINE:
What is it?
---
## MARIA:
A condition passed along in the blood.
---
## &nbsp;
I can slow it some, but
the end remains the same.
---
## JUSTINE:
That is unfair.
---
## MARIA:
I agree.
---
## JUSTINE:
You did nothing to
earn this but be born.
---
## MARIA:
Being born is when the injustice
---
## &nbsp;
of the world starts, lamb.
---
---
## MARIA:
Better.
---
## &nbsp;
Hard to do my work with tremors.
---
## JUSTINE:
You will die of this condition?
--

## MARIA:
I will.
---
## JUSTINE:
Soon?
--

## MARIA:
Perhaps.
---
## &nbsp;
Perhaps not.
---
## JUSTINE:
I see.
---
## MARIA:
Do you?
---
## JUSTINE:
The substance in my blood,
you hope to replicate it.
---
## MARIA:
Yes.
---
## JUSTINE:
Not only replicate
but use it on yourself,
---
## &nbsp;
make it a part of you.
---
## MARIA:
I have known for over
two years my end was coming
---
## &nbsp;
and in those years
---
## &nbsp;
everything I have worked
on has been to find a way
---
## &nbsp;
to halt it, if not cure it outright.
---
## &nbsp;
All my experiments, my research,
---
## &nbsp;
all lead towards this single end.
---
## &nbsp;
What little fortune I had…gone.
---
## &nbsp;
These books…rumors have
circled for a century
---
## &nbsp;
about that old castle and the mad doctor,
---
## &nbsp;
his experiments in cheating death.
---
## &nbsp;
What had I to lose, hmm?
---
## &nbsp;
But in my heart I doubted I
would really find anything.
---
## &nbsp;
What I did find was
beyond my wildest hopes.
---
## &nbsp;
With your help, with the
notes in these books,
---
## &nbsp;
for the first time in
two years I have hope.
---
## &nbsp;
Let’s call him your “father”.
---
## &nbsp;
Your father, who has the kind of intellect
---
## &nbsp;
the world only sees once
every two hundred years.
---
## &nbsp;
His combining of ancient
philosophy, modern science…
---
## &nbsp;
it’s staggering.
---
## &nbsp;
He makes these leaps in logic
---
## &nbsp;
which seems on the surface like insanity
---
## &nbsp;
but when you see how he works it through…
---
## &nbsp;
he was able to see outcomes
years before he reached them.
---
## &nbsp;
See here? That glorious
substance in your blood,
---
## &nbsp;
this is how he created it.
---
## &nbsp;
By combining the works of Lavoisier and Scheel with Paracelsus and…
---
## &nbsp;
This is why I am so stymied!
---
## &nbsp;
This is not science as
I know it…it’s alchemy!
---
## &nbsp;
You are science and superstition together!
---
## JUSTINE:
No.
--

## MARIA:
Yes, I tell you, look at these…
---
## JUSTINE:
I am not some experiment.
---
## &nbsp;
Perhaps I was once, but that was long ago.
---
## &nbsp;
I am a living being. I think and I feel.
---
## MARIA:
Justine.
---
## JUSTINE:
You have only just known me
---
## &nbsp;
and what you met was an empty shell.
---
## &nbsp;
But every minute I become more…myself.
---
## MARIA:
Of course. I did not
mean to imply I was...
---
## JUSTINE:
I think that you have
been long without company.
---
## MARIA:
That is not untrue.
---
## JUSTINE:
I will help you, Maria.
---
## &nbsp;
I am grateful to you.
---
## &nbsp;
And I find that I despise unfairness.
---
## &nbsp;
But I warn you now…I am no pet
or orphan or laboratory rat.
---
## &nbsp;
Forget that at your peril.
---
## MARIA:
Are you capable of
finishing a conversation
---
## &nbsp;
without a threat?
---
## JUSTINE:
I can hear her. Justine.
---
## &nbsp;
The Justine from 100 years ago.
---
## &nbsp;
She is a whisper at the back of my mind.
---
## &nbsp;
And instinct given voice.
---
## &nbsp;
I know that hers was a brutal life
---
## &nbsp;
in which she was used
and broken and powerless.
---
## &nbsp;
I will be none of these things.
---
## MARIA:
It must be nice to have power.
---
## &nbsp;
Are you brave enough to
help someone else get it?
---
## &nbsp;
Or would you rather stand there
---
## &nbsp;
snarling like a cornered wolf?
---
## JUSTINE:
What do you need of me?
---
## MARIA:
Let’s roll up those sleeves
---
## &nbsp;
and get a look at your scars.
---

MARIA screams in frustration
---
## JUSTINE:
What is it?
--

## MARIA:
It’s impossible, that’s what it is!
---
## &nbsp;
Why didn’t you tell me
your father had a fortune at his finger tips?
---
## JUSTINE:
I thought it was obvious.
---
## MARIA:
Look. Look at the equipment he designed.
---
## &nbsp;
The supplies alone could ruin me.
---
## &nbsp;
I cannot come this close and fail.
---
## MARIA:
God, I am so close!!
--

## JUSTINE:
I don’t understand.
---
## MARIA:
I cannot replicate your
father’s experiments.
---
## JUSTINE:
You don’t understand his journal?
--

## MARIA:
No. I understand it very well…
---
## JUSTINE:
Maria, you are shaking.
--

## &nbsp;
…well enough to get started, but…Justine,
---
## &nbsp;
he built equipment that doesn’t exist even now.
---
## MARIA:
he brought in rare
chemicals and electronic conductors and…
--

## JUSTINE:
Look at your hands.
---
## MARIA:
I can see my bloody hands!
---
## &nbsp;
You think I am so addled I do
not know my body is failing me?
---
## &nbsp;
To obtain everything I need,
---
## &nbsp;
it would cost me more than what I have.
---
## MARIA:
Much more.
---
## JUSTINE:
I see.
---
## MARIA:
“I see,” she says.
---
## &nbsp;
“I see.” What do you _see_?
---
## &nbsp;
Do you see what mortality
really looks like?
---
## &nbsp;
Are you an Olympian staring
down at poor wretched humanity?
---
## JUSTINE:
In a way.
---
## &nbsp;
You think I do not care for you?
---
## &nbsp;
I do. You have shown me true kindness
---
## &nbsp;
and I have known precious little of that.
---
## &nbsp;
But, can I understand what
this sickness is doing to you?
---
## &nbsp;
No. I can only watch.
---
## MARIA:
I do not need you to watch.
---
## &nbsp;
I need you to save me.
---
## JUSTINE:
I do not know how.
---
## &nbsp;
Come. Sit. Breathe.
---
## MARIA:
Ten minutes ago I drank
a vile of your blood.
---
## JUSTINE:
What?
---
## &nbsp;
It became clear I could
never purchase what I needed.
---
## &nbsp;
I grew desperate, I thought
---
## &nbsp;
perhaps if I ingested the blood
---
## &nbsp;
then my body would
metabolize the substance and…
---
## &nbsp;
Madness I know, but what
have I left but madness?
---
## JUSTINE:
I can give you more blood.
---
## MARIA:
It won’t make a whit of difference.
---
## &nbsp;
Without the necessary equipment,
---
## &nbsp;
I cannot extract the substance,
---
## &nbsp;
And until I do that…useless.
---
## &nbsp;
It’s all useless.
---
---
## JUSTINE:
Better?
---
## MARIA:
There is no better for me.
---

MARIA gasps in pain
---
## &nbsp;
Justine. Help.
---
## &nbsp;
The drink. The drink.

## &nbsp;
Hurry, please!

template: noise
MARIA gasping
---
---
## JUSTINE:
Does that happen often?
---
## MARIA:
Not usually that bad, no.
---
## JUSTINE:
I am sorry.
---
## MARIA:
That’s kind.
---
## &nbsp;
Pointless, but kind.
---
## JUSTINE:
This is cruel, that we
were to meet at the end.
---
## MARIA:
I refuse for this to be the end.
---
## JUSTINE:
You’re strong willed. That is good.
---
## &nbsp;
But nature is stronger.
---
## MARIA:
Well, when my father got this bad,
---
## &nbsp;
he lived for two more years.
---
## &nbsp;
I’m not done yet.
---
## JUSTINE:
They were hard years, I imagine.
---
## MARIA:
Would you help me clean up this chaos?
---
## JUSTINE:
Of course.
---
## &nbsp;
I’ll have a difficult
time making it up the stairs without it.
---
## JUSTINE:
I can help with that too.
---
## MARIA:
You know, I think that the
Justine of all those years ago
---
## &nbsp;
must have been a very kind woman.
---
## &nbsp;
That part of you is returning.
---
## &nbsp;
I’ve seen her more and more each day.
---
## JUSTINE:
Sometimes, when I
remember the old castle,
---
## &nbsp;
I can feel her fear.
---
## &nbsp;
I think she spent much of her life
---
## &nbsp;
fearing reprisal if she
said the wrong thing,
---
## &nbsp;
or did the wrong thing.
---
## &nbsp;
But here…here I am not afraid.
---
## MARIA:
Thank you for that.
---
## &nbsp;
I never wed nor had children.
---
## &nbsp;
The thought of caring for
another’s needs after my father…
---
## &nbsp;
at least you require very little.
---
## JUSTINE:
Books more than anything else.
---
## MARIA:
You are working your way
through my books like a _trogium pulsatorium_.
---
## &nbsp;
A book worm.
---
## JUSTINE:
Oh. Now you are showing off.
---
## MARIA:
And you are retaining all you read?
---
## JUSTINE:
Oh. Yes.
---
## &nbsp;
But still it doesn’t satisfy me.
---
## &nbsp;
I can now read in 8 languages
---
## &nbsp;
and tell you the name
of every Roman emperor
---
## &nbsp;
but still I want more.
---
## MARIA:
That is the way of knowledge,
---
## &nbsp;
if you’re a good student.
---
## MARIA:
When I pass.
--

## JUSTINE:
No.
---
## MARIA:
When I pass, I would
like to leave all of this,
---
## &nbsp;
all my things, to you.
---
## JUSTINE:
You barely know me.
---
## MARIA:
I know you well enough,
---
## &nbsp;
and I have no one else.
---
## &nbsp;
I’d rather see you
make good use of my books
---
## &nbsp;
than see all this torn
apart by squabbling cousins
---
## &nbsp;
I have never even met.
---
## JUSTINE:
Your death is still a long time off.
---
## MARIA:
That is a sweet thought. Isn’t it?
---
---
## &nbsp;
To the future Kastellan of Schloss Salenegg!
---
## &nbsp;
May her stewardship be joyous
---
## &nbsp;
but not too soon.
---
## JUSTINE:
Prost!
---
---
## MARIA:
I am sorry about that. Truly.
---
## JUSTINE:
It was a fine toast.
---
## MARIA:
No.
---
## &nbsp;
You see,
---
## &nbsp;
the powder was already in your glass.
---
## &nbsp;
It was a very strong dosage.
---
## &nbsp;
You should be...
---
## &nbsp;
There it is.
---
## &nbsp;
It would kill a normal human, but well…
---
## MARIA:
you understand.
--

## JUSTINE:
What have you…Maria…
---
## MARIA:
I put it there days ago
---
## &nbsp;
hoping I would not need it.
---
## &nbsp;
But life plays cruel tricks,
---
## &nbsp;
does it not?
---
## JUSTINE:
(gasping) Maria!
---
## MARIA:
We do what we must.

## JANOS:
Gentle fellows.
---
## &nbsp;
Good ladies.
---
## &nbsp;
The tale I’m about to tell you
---
## &nbsp;
will chill your blood
and quicken your pulse.
---
## &nbsp;
If you feel that your constitution
---
## &nbsp;
is in any way compromised,
---
## &nbsp;
now is the moment to turn away.
---
## &nbsp;
No one here will think the less of you!
---
## &nbsp;
Behind this curtain lurks a creature
---
## &nbsp;
cursed by both nature
and science. Alive? Yes.
---
## &nbsp;
But at what price, I ask you?
---
## &nbsp;
Gather around. Gather around.
---
## &nbsp;
Picture a beautiful lass, a
bride-to-be on her wedding day.
---
## &nbsp;
Graceful, delicate, pure.
---
## &nbsp;
But as so often happens,
a moment’s doubt,
---
## &nbsp;
a moment’s uncertainty
---
## &nbsp;
and this poor girl flees from the altar!
---
## &nbsp;
Perhaps her husband was a lout.
---
## &nbsp;
Perhaps she didn’t truly
prefer the company of men.
---
## &nbsp;
Whatever her reasons,
---
## &nbsp;
the sweet child found herself
running into the woods
---
## &nbsp;
right from the arms of her betrothed
---
## &nbsp;
and into the savage claws
of a great brown bear.
---
## &nbsp;
A flash of fang, a slash of the claw.
---
## &nbsp;
And what was once a beautiful lady
---
## &nbsp;
was a gored and savaged mess.
---
## &nbsp;
Bleeding, broken and beyond all hope.
---
## &nbsp;
Or was she?
---
## &nbsp;
For who should happen
by this grizzly site but Dr. Janos Vystario!
---
## &nbsp;
Quick as a flash, I set myself to work!
---
## &nbsp;
Stitches and sutures and more than a little luck,
---
## &nbsp;
and a life was saved…
but forever changed.
---
## &nbsp;
I am but a mortal man, and her
wounds were most grievous.
---
## &nbsp;
What I am about to show you
---
## &nbsp;
is the result of that fateful night.
---
## &nbsp;
They say beauty is in
the eye of the beholder.
---
## &nbsp;
And so, behold…The Jigsaw Bride!

## JUSTINE:
He lies. Free me!
--

## JANOS:
Gape at her scars! There and there!
---
## &nbsp;
Each limb reattached like a doll sewed back up!
---
## JUSTINE:
No I am not as he says!
My name is Justine! Help me!
---
## JANOS:
The poor creature, her
mind shattered by the trauma.
---
## JUSTINE:
He bought me from a faithless swine who…
--

## JANOS:
The thanks I get for saving her life.
---
## JUSTINE:
No! I am no bride.
---
## &nbsp;
I was created in a lab in
the ruined manse north of here
---
## &nbsp;
one hundred years ago!
---
template: noise
JANOS laughing
---
## JANOS:
Poor creature. Poor, poor creature.
---
## &nbsp;
Come. Right this way.
---
## &nbsp;
Right this way, to the remains of a genuine mermaid, from the distant subcontinent!
---
---
## &nbsp;
My dear. You are a natural.
---
template: noise
JUSTINE screams
---
template: noise
unsettling plucky string music
---
---
## JANOS:
57, 58, 59 aaaaaaand 60. 
---
## &nbsp;
Oh. Sweet Justine,
---
## &nbsp;
you’ve made me a very happy man.
---
## JUSTINE:
Come closer let’s see
how happy I make you.
---
## JANOS:
You made your feelings
for me abundantly clear.
---
## JUSTINE:
I will kill you.
---
## JANOS:
You might find that line rather long.
---
## JUSTINE:
This is no jest, little man.
---
## &nbsp;
I will snap your neck.
---
## JANOS:
I don’t think so.
---
## JUSTINE:
This cage will not hold me forever.
---
## JANOS:
I’m glad I still have it!
---
## &nbsp;
A few years back I found
this feral boy in the Carpathians.
---
## &nbsp;
God, what a performer.
---
## &nbsp;
All fur and teeth and claws, he was.
---
## JUSTINE:
And he escaped?
---
## JANOS:
Yes. Let’s say he escaped.
---
## &nbsp;
I had this old thing built for him.
---
## &nbsp;
He looked scrawny
---
## &nbsp;
but my God he could pull a
sapling right of the ground!
---
## JANOS:
The crowds loved it.
--

## JUSTINE:
Shut up.
---
## JANOS:
The “Werewolf of Medias”, I called him.
---
## &nbsp;
Of course he wasn’t any such thing.
---
## &nbsp;
Our mutual friend explained
---
## &nbsp;
he just had some condition
---
## &nbsp;
that made him sprout hair all over.
---
## &nbsp;
I forget what it’s called…
---
## JUSTINE:
I will kill her too.
---
## JANOS:
Every word that comes from
your mouth is dripping blood.
---
## &nbsp;
It’ll lead you to an early grave.
---
## JUSTINE:
I am over 100 years old
---
## &nbsp;
and I believe I have many
more years ahead of me.
---
## JANOS:
Maria said you were a nutter.
---
## JUSTINE:
She knows what I really am.
---
## JANOS:
That mad story about
being made in a lab?
---
## &nbsp;
Tell me the truth of it,
---
## &nbsp;
and maybe I’ll put it in the patter.
---
## JUSTINE:
Free me or leave me alone.
---
## JANOS:
Justine. How are we gonna
become friends if we don’t chat?
---
## JUSTINE:
You cannot think that
friendship is a possibility.
---
## JANOS:
I run a freak show, m’dear.
---
## JANOS:
I have an expansive view on the possible.
--

## JUSTINE:
Leave me!
---
## JANOS:
You’re looking at the
situation all the wrong way.
--

## JUSTINE:
Go!
---
## JANOS:
Go where?
---
## &nbsp;
This is my home.
---
## &nbsp;
And what I want you to understand is…
---
## &nbsp;
this could be _your_ home too.
---
## JANOS:
Have you even ever had a home before?
--

## JUSTINE:
Yes.
---
## JANOS:
Maria’s stuffy decrepit castle?
---
## &nbsp;
That place is falling
apart as quickly as she is.
---
## &nbsp;
But here…the Menagerie of the Macabre…
---
## &nbsp;
We travel all of Europe!
---
## &nbsp;
Think of the sites you’ll see.
---
## &nbsp;
Rome, Paris…
---
## &nbsp;
god! Paris! You’ll swoon, mark my words.
---
## &nbsp;
You’re missing the other joy
---
## &nbsp;
of the theatrical life you know.
---
## JUSTINE:
Oh. What is that?
---
## JANOS:
We are a family. We
look after each other.
---
## JUSTINE:
I have never felt so welcome.
---
## JANOS:
That old thing? Merely
a temporary situation.
---
## JUSTINE:
What do you mean?
---
## JANOS:
Those bars are just for my safety
---
## &nbsp;
while you…acclimate to
your new environment.
---
## &nbsp;
Once I’m convinced you won’t throttle me
---
## &nbsp;
with my own innards, out you go.
---
## JUSTINE:
Truly?
---
## JANOS:
After a couple of months
---
## &nbsp;
the Werewolf and I were
playing cards nightly.
---
## JUSTINE:
I won’t kill you. I promise.
---
## JANOS:
Sweet girl.
---
## &nbsp;
Never assume that dressing
like a fool means that one _is_ a fool.
---
## JUSTINE:
I swear it!
---
## JANOS:
Justine, Justine, Justine.
---
## &nbsp;
That’s just not how this works.
---
## &nbsp;
Let’s say I’m a dunce
---
## JANOS:
and open that cage for you here and now.
--

## JUSTINE:
Do it.
---
## JANOS:
You’ll run from this place
---
## &nbsp;
and I’ll have a crushed
skull for my troubles.
---
## JUSTINE:
Oh. I’m not as strong as all that.
---
## JANOS:
I remember you lifting me
off the ground with one hand.
---
## &nbsp;
I’ve lived this long by
recognizing fights I can’t win.
---
## JUSTINE:
So, so tell me.
---
## JANOS:
Tell you what?
---
## JUSTINE:
How I can earn your trust.
---
## JANOS:
She’s beginning to understand the game.
---
## &nbsp;
In truth, I don’t know
how you can earn it, yet.
---
## &nbsp;
But, each night I’ll sit here with you.
---
## &nbsp;
We’ll talk, I’ll know you better,
you’ll know me better.
---
## &nbsp;
We’ll wile away the time
and the time will come.
---
## &nbsp;
Not _may_ but _will_,
---
## &nbsp;
when I decide, “Justine has fallen in love with this life”
---
## &nbsp;
and the cage will be no more.
---
## JUSTINE:
I do not exist to play games.
---
## JANOS:
Games are all life is, and playing them is all we do.
---
---
## JANOS:
I thank you for the pleasant chat, Justine.
---
## &nbsp;
…I just realized I have no
idea what your last name is.
---
## JUSTINE:
I have none. Not that I remember.
---
## JANOS:
Would you like me to give you one?
---
## &nbsp;
You’ve no doubt noticed my skill with nom de plumes.
---
## JUSTINE:
I want nothing from you.
---
## JANOS:
Except your freedom.
---
## JUSTINE:
Keeping me here against
my will, this is a crime.
---
## JANOS:
My father once said to
me that crime doesn’t pay.
---
## &nbsp;
I said to him,
---
## &nbsp;
“But Da, then why are
there so many criminals?”
---
template: noise
energetic strings
---
---
## JANOS:
So I’ve had that thing
---
## &nbsp;
since Isabella decided
to flee our wedding night
---
## &nbsp;
with my heart in one hand
and my gold in the other.
---
## JUSTINE:
Was she then mauled by a bear?
---
## JANOS:
So much as I wish it, no.
---
## &nbsp;
Last I heard she set up with
some Bavarian Burgomeister.
---
## JUSTINE:
And yet you kept her dress.
---
## JANOS:
I’m the soul of sentimentalism.
---
## &nbsp;
I’ve kept many odd things over the years.
---
## &nbsp;
You never know what
might come in handy.
---
## JUSTINE:
How very forward thinking of you.
---
## JANOS:
The life of a vagabond.
---
## JANOS:
Tho’ if I were being honest…
--

## JUSTINE:
Why start now?
---
## JANOS:
If I were being honest,
---
## &nbsp;
to choose between this life
---
## &nbsp;
and the contentment of
the of home and wealth…
---
## &nbsp;
I’d pick this life every time.
---
## JUSTINE:
Why?
---
## JANOS:
Well, I think there is a reason
---
## JANOS:
the common folk flock to
circuses and theaters and...
--

## JUSTINE:
Freak shows?
---
## JANOS:
_Menagerie of the Macabre_, my dear.
--

## JUSTINE:
It is a freak show.
---
## JANOS:
You have so much to
learn about advertising.
---
## &nbsp;
But yes, they flock to us
no matter where they go.
---
## &nbsp;
Why?
---
## &nbsp;
Because we are emissaries
of the extraordinary
---
## &nbsp;
Shepherds, innkeeps, bankers, house fraus…
---
## &nbsp;
They live in a perpetual
state of monotony.
---
## &nbsp;
They wake, they work,
they eat, they sleep.
---
## &nbsp;
Over, and over, and over.
---
## &nbsp;
But in their heart of hearts
---
## &nbsp;
they yearn to believe
---
## &nbsp;
that there’s still magic left in the world.
---
## JUSTINE:
Oh. Is that what I am?
---
## &nbsp;
Magic?
---
## JANOS:
You’re certainly extraordinary.
---
## &nbsp;
But that’s the beauty of living in a world
---
## &nbsp;
in which scientific advancement
outpaces our understanding.
---
## &nbsp;
Science, magic, fantasy…
are all one and the same.
---
## JUSTINE:
You’re drunk.
---
## JANOS:
No, no, no. Listen.
---
## &nbsp;
A few years ago,
the idea of turning fire from red to blue
---
## &nbsp;
would’ve gotten one hung as a witch.
---
## &nbsp;
Now we know that adding a few chemicals
---
## &nbsp;
to the fire can change everything.
---
## &nbsp;
Nothing sorcerous about it.
---
## &nbsp;
What you are is something
we don’t understand…yet.
---
## &nbsp;
And so long as you remain mysterious,
---
## &nbsp;
you will remain magical. Not so bad a thing, yeah?
---
## JUSTINE:
Spend a day in my cage
and see how magical you feel.
---
## JANOS:
You are fed and warm and sheltered,
---
## &nbsp;
not to mention blessed with my company.
---
## &nbsp;
There are worse fates.
---
## &nbsp;
After all these weeks,
---
## &nbsp;
you haven’t found anything
pleasant about all this?
---
## &nbsp;
Anything at all?
---
## JUSTINE:
How much did Maria tell you about me?
---
## JANOS:
Not much.
---
## &nbsp;
A scarred amnesiac with rather remarkable physical and mental abilities.
---
## JUSTINE:
My memory, it slowly returns.
---
## &nbsp;
Everyday I remember a bit more.
---
## JANOS:
Oh yes?
---
## JUSTINE:
Oh yes. In my life before this life,
---
## &nbsp;
I was a servant.
---
## &nbsp;
I cleaned and cooked and scraped
for men no better than me,
---
## &nbsp;
just richer than me.
---
## JANOS:
A pox on those born wealthy.
---
## JUSTINE:
I slept in a tiny room
with three other women.
---
## &nbsp;
Now I don’t recall their names
but I can see their faces…
---
## &nbsp;
how tired they were, how afraid.
---
## JANOS:
Of the men they serve?
---
## JUSTINE:
Oh yes. Afraid of angering them,
---
## &nbsp;
afraid of what they would do
if they were in their cups.
---
## &nbsp;
There is nothing worse
than a life lived in fear.
---
## &nbsp;
I hate this cage,
but I do not fear this place.
---
## &nbsp;
And I do not fear you.
---
## JUSTINE:
What is this?
--

## JANOS:
Whiskey.
---
## &nbsp;
Courage for those who need it and
---
## &nbsp;
numbness for those who don’t.
---
## JUSTINE:
Which do you need?
---
## JANOS:
I do not fear you either.
---
template: noise
JUSTINE roars, JANOS screams
---
## JUSTINE:
Like a lion you are.
---
## JANOS:
Damn it. I did not
expect you to do that!
---
## JUSTINE:
How have you lived this long, Vystario,
---
## &nbsp;
without learning how to anticipate?
---
## JANOS:
If I could read a woman’s mind
---
## &nbsp;
I’d still have a bride and
not just a wedding dress!
---
## JUSTINE:
Whoo. My dress now!
---
## &nbsp;
What little you left of it for me.
---
## JANOS:
Well come now.
---
## &nbsp;
Those beautiful scars of
yours yearn to be seen.
---
## &nbsp;
And Marith is passable seamstress!
---
## JUSTINE:
Which one is Marith?
--

## JANOS:
The pinhead.
---
## JUSTINE:
Ah. I hate that term.
---
## JANOS:
She’s never complained.
---
## JUSTINE:
Not voicing her displeasure
---
## &nbsp;
does not mean that there is none.
---
## JANOS:
I work in sensationalism!
---
## &nbsp;
Am I to call her “Marith,
---
## &nbsp;
the woman with a very
slight cranial deformity”? 
---
## &nbsp;
Or “Enzo, the man who
stands just beneath 5-feet tall”? Or…
---
## JUSTINE:
Or Justine.
---
## &nbsp;
The relatively normal looking woman
---
## &nbsp;
with two different colored eyes.
---
## JANOS:
Even without the eyes, or the scars,
---
## &nbsp;
you are far from normal.
---
## JUSTINE:
Oh. You mean my strength, my mind?
---
## &nbsp;
What good does that do me in hear?
---
## JANOS:
You will not be in that cage forever.
---
## JUSTINE:
And even if I were free of
it, am I not still a woman?
---
## &nbsp;
I could walk into any
university in Europe,
---
## &nbsp;
perfectly explain the
most complex formulas,
---
## &nbsp;
and they’d still tell me to go dust the bookshelves.
---
## JANOS:
A pox on the pompous learned.
---
## JUSTINE:
What has Maria’s
education gotten her, 
---
## &nbsp;
beyond membership in some scientific society…
---
## JANOS:
How’s that?
---
## JUSTINE:
The Graubünden’s Natural Research Society.
---
## JANOS:
Oh. Yes. That.
---
## &nbsp;
You know they think
she’s a man, don’t you?
---
## JUSTINE:
What?
--

## JANOS:
Indeed.
---
## &nbsp;
They’ve never actually met her.
---
## JUSTINE:
How is this possible?
---
## JANOS:
They know her through letters
---
## &nbsp;
and scientific papers she’s sent them.
---
## &nbsp;
She only once ever attended one
of their meetings in person,
---
## &nbsp;
when she was inducted.
---
## &nbsp;
And the person who they met…
---
## &nbsp;
well, he looked at awful lot like me.
---
## JUSTINE:
You…posed as Maria?
---
## JANOS:
I posed as “Herr von Moos”. I had the papers, 
---
## &nbsp;
and what I lacked in actual knowledge,
---
## &nbsp;
I more than made up for in winning charm.
---
## JUSTINE:
That was a kind thing to do.
---
## JANOS:
I didn’t do it for free.
---
## JUSTINE:
All the same. You must care for Maria.
---
## JANOS:
She is extraordinary, like you.
---
## JANOS:
The world is cruel to the extraordinary.
--

## JUSTINE:
Yes.
---
## JANOS:
Yet, we still need them.
---
## &nbsp;
People who can remind us that the universe
---
## &nbsp;
is full of wonders.
---
## JUSTINE:
You love her.
---
## JANOS:
The universe?
---
## JUSTINE:
Maria.
---
## JANOS:
After a fashion.
---
## &nbsp;
She fascinates me…
---
## &nbsp;
a woman who could’ve
married a dozen wealthy men,
---
## &nbsp;
lived a life of ease and comfort.
---
## &nbsp;
And instead she chose to abandon all that
---
## &nbsp;
and devote herself to studying
the mysteries of life itself.
---
## JUSTINE:
I thought you disliked
those born wealthy.
---
## JANOS:
The exceptional are
always the exception.
---
## JUSTINE:
She is dying.
---
## JANOS:
Yes, I know.
---
## JUSTINE:
She sold me to you in hopes that the money you paid for me
---
## &nbsp;
would afford her a cure.
---
## JANOS:
Between my money and your blood.
---
## &nbsp;
You hate her,
and I understand that.
---
## &nbsp;
Perhaps in time
---
## &nbsp;
you will understand why
she did what she did.
---
## JUSTINE:
Oh. I understand it now.
---
## &nbsp;
It does nothing to diminish my hate.
---
## JANOS:
Her life will end soon, and badly.
---
## &nbsp;
Might you not behave
against your conscience
---
## &nbsp;
to save yourself that?
---
## JUSTINE:
I will never know.
---
## JANOS:
You should be more
appreciative of that than you are.
---
## JUSTINE:
Don’t tell me what I should be.
---
## JANOS:
Is it so hard to imagine
what her life may be?
---
## JUSTINE:
Ah. Yes. Sympathy for
those who do horrible things,
---
## &nbsp;
because are they not people?
---
## &nbsp;
Do they not ache, and yearn, and bleed?
---
## &nbsp;
I tell you something I
learned in no book, Vystario.
---
## JUSTINE:
Forgiveness is a tool of the evil.
--

## JANOS:
What?
---
## JUSTINE:
Oh yes.
---
## &nbsp;
A man does something
cruel, hurtful, vicious…
---
## &nbsp;
then he comes to those he has wronged and says
---
## &nbsp;
“Oh, but forgive me, please forgive me!”
---
## &nbsp;
“I see now that I was wrong
and I am better for it.”
---
## &nbsp;
And the injured one forgives him.
---
## JANOS:
A charitable act.
--

## JUSTINE:
A foolish act.
---
## &nbsp;
For you see, once the forgiveness is given
---
## &nbsp;
the evil man takes it as absolution,
---
## &nbsp;
as permission to keep
behaving in a cruel way.
---
## &nbsp;
And when he does harm
again, he simply says, 
---
## &nbsp;
“But forgive me! Please forgive me!”,
---
## &nbsp;
And the cycle continues.
---
## JANOS:
You think people
cannot learn to be better
---
## &nbsp;
than their worse selves?
---
## JUSTINE:
I think they can.
But I think they almost never do.
---
## JANOS:
A leopard cannot change its spots.
---
## JUSTINE:
Ah. No. But it will work very hard
---
## &nbsp;
to convince you that they are stripes.
---
## &nbsp;
You will do well to remember that.
---
## JANOS:
Says the amnesiac.
--

## JUSTINE:
Ha ha.
---
## &nbsp;
You’re a wit. I give you that.
---
## JANOS:
Years in show business. I
give the people what they want.
---
## JUSTINE:
Oh. Is that what I am?
---
## JUSTINE:
What the people want?
--

## JANOS:
Oh. Yes.
---
## &nbsp;
The days of mythological
beasties are over.
---
## &nbsp;
Now it’s all medical oddities.
---
## &nbsp;
They’re just more…real.
---
## JUSTINE:
Because reality is more
fearful than fantasy.
---
## JANOS:
And now she’s catching on.
---
## &nbsp;
Well my dear…
---
## &nbsp;
I thank you for yet another
stimulating conversation.
---
## JUSTINE:
Don’t.
--

## JANOS:
Don’t what?
---
## JUSTINE:
Don’t thank me.
---
## &nbsp;
Free me.
---
## JANOS:
I think you’re more fond of me
---
## JANOS:
than you were those weeks ago.
--

## JUSTINE:
I am.
---
## JANOS:
Perhaps you’ve come to view my Menagerie with a certain warmth.
---
## JUSTINE:
Yes.
---
## JANOS:
What I really wonder is…
---
## &nbsp;
have you truly changed?
---
## &nbsp;
Or are you just telling me your spots are stripes?
---
## &nbsp;
Those scuffs?
---
## &nbsp;
You’ve been trying to unfasten
the bars when I’m not around.
---
## &nbsp;
Werewolf tried the same thing,
---
## &nbsp;
and never got them to budge an inch.

JUSTINE growls

## JANOS:
Seems I’m getting better at
anticipating all the time.
---
## &nbsp;
Until tomorrow, Justine.
---
## JUSTINE:
Until tomorrow Reggie.
---
## JANOS:
I hate that name.
---
## JUSTINE:
I know.

template: noise

---
---
## MARIA:
Reggie.
---
## &nbsp;
I apologize for my delay
in writing back to you.
---
## &nbsp;
As you can surely imagine
---
## &nbsp;
my energy’s been focused
entirely on my experiments.
---
## &nbsp;
It seems as though I was
in my lab for mere minutes
---
## &nbsp;
but now I realize it has been months.
---
## &nbsp;
Your letter last week
indicated you were in Lyon,
---
## &nbsp;
so I have written you there.
---
## &nbsp;
I sincerely hope you receive this.
---
## &nbsp;
The funds you provided me with
---
## &nbsp;
have allowed me to continue
my research as needed.
---
## &nbsp;
However, I am sorry to
say that all efforts
---
## &nbsp;
to replicate the alchemical
substance have failed.
---
## &nbsp;
My illness has reached what I
fear may be its final stages.
---
## &nbsp;
Even writing this letter proved impossible
---
## &nbsp;
without my medicine and already
I can feel it failing me.
---
## &nbsp;
So I ask you this favor:
---
## &nbsp;
Reggie, I need Justine back.
---
## &nbsp;
More importantly, I need her blood.
---
## &nbsp;
The vials I had have
already been exhausted,
---
## &nbsp;
much faster than I had imagined.
---
## &nbsp;
I know in my soul the key
to my salvation is there.
---
## &nbsp;
And so I ask, please and with all haste,
---
## &nbsp;
return to me with her.
---
## &nbsp;
Or with her blood.
---
## &nbsp;
Hurry, my dear friend.
---
## &nbsp;
My time is short.
---
## &nbsp;
Love, Maria.

Christ. Be careful with
those jars, will you?
---
## JANOS:
You don’t want to stink
of formaldehyde all day!

## JUSTINE:
Janos!

## &nbsp;
All right.

## &nbsp;
Everyone else is occupied. Right?

## JUSTINE:
Wait.

## JANOS:
I need to know, Justine.

## &nbsp;
And I need to know, now.

## JUSTINE:
What is happening?

## JANOS:
Can I trust you?
---
## &nbsp;
I’ve kept you as my
guest these long months.
---
## &nbsp;
We’ve talked.
---
## &nbsp;
We’ve…come to understand
each other a bit now.
---
## JANOS:
Haven’t we?
--

## JUSTINE:
Yes.
---
## JANOS:
I don’t want to hurt you.

## JUSTINE:
I don’t want that either.
---
## JANOS:
I care about you, in my way.
---
## &nbsp;
And I believe things as rare and wondrous
---
## &nbsp;
as you need to be protected and preserved.
---
## JUSTINE:
Thank you.
---
## &nbsp;
Now please tell me what is happening.
---
## JANOS:
We’re pulling out States
and returning to Geneva.
---
## JUSTINE:
Why?
---
## JANOS:
Why do you think?
---
## &nbsp;
Maria is dying.
---
## JUSTINE:
She has been dying as
long as I have know her.
---
## JANOS:
No. I mean she is at her end.
---
## JUSTINE:
Her experiments failed?
--

## JANOS:
Yes.
---
## JUSTINE:
She could not replicate that which I am?
---
## JANOS:
No.
---
template: noise
JUSTINE laughs
---
## JANOS:
This is no laughing matter.
--

## JUSTINE:
It is!
---
## &nbsp;
Of course it is.
---
## &nbsp;
Don’t you see,
---
## &nbsp;
everything you did to me,
---
## &nbsp;
the money you paid for me,
---
## JUSTINE:
her betrayal of me…
all of it for nothing.
--

## JANOS:
Stop it.
---
## JUSTINE:
It is the only fairness the world knows.
---
## &nbsp;
Great and weak. Rich and poor.
---
## &nbsp;
All will fail and die.
---
## &nbsp;
Except perhaps, me.
---
## JANOS:
I could kill you here and now.
---
## JUSTINE:
You won’t.
---
## &nbsp;
Not because you are a coward,
I know that about you now.
---
## &nbsp;
There is steel in you.
---
## &nbsp;
You are brave enough to care for as strange a thing as me.
---
## JANOS:
Maria is my friend.
---
## &nbsp;
If I can help her, I want to.
---
## JUSTINE:
I thought you did nothing
you could not profit from.
---
## JANOS:
I do. I did.
---
## &nbsp;
But it’s Maria.
---
## JUSTINE:
It is more than that.
---
## JANOS:
I know. But I can’t believe
---
## &nbsp;
that you’d come with me
at your own free will
---
## &nbsp;
back to the place you were betrayed.
---
## &nbsp;
To the woman who betrayed you.
---
## JUSTINE:
Is that so unbelievable?
---
## JANOS:
You are magnificent.
---
## &nbsp;
You are primal, but you are not kind,
---
## &nbsp;
and you are not forgiving.
---
## &nbsp;
You said so yourself.
---
## JUSTINE:
I can only be that which I am.
---
## JANOS:
Exactly.
---
## JUSTINE:
And what I am is…learning.
---
## &nbsp;
I am like a child, Janos,
---
## &nbsp;
perpetually growing.
---
## &nbsp;
The world teaches me
---
## &nbsp;
and what I learn changes me.
---
## &nbsp;
I am like any other in this way.
---
## JANOS:
She needs your blood.
--

## JUSTINE:
I know.
---
## JANOS:
Perhaps a great deal of it.
--

## JUSTINE:
I will heal.
---
## JANOS:
You’ll do it then?
---
## &nbsp;
You’d come with us?
---
## &nbsp;
Give of yourself so willingly?
---
## JUSTINE:
I don’t think you understand.
---
## &nbsp;
This is not my moment. It is yours.
---
## &nbsp;
What I do or not depends entirely on you.
---
## &nbsp;
I may go with you to Geneva.
---
## &nbsp;
I may see Maria.
---
## &nbsp;
I may snap your neck as soon
as I get free of this cage.
---
## &nbsp;
You could shoot me here and now
---
## &nbsp;
and hope that you could
collect enough my blood
---
## &nbsp;
before it seeps into the dirt.
---
## &nbsp;
So many potential outcomes, all
waiting on Janos Vystario.
---
## JANOS:
It would be a wise thing
for me to kill you here.
---
## JUSTINE:
I agree.
---
## JANOS:
I don’t even know if
the bullet will kill you.
--

## JUSTINE:
Nor do I.
---
## &nbsp;
But I imagine if you get
it in the right place
---
## &nbsp;
it will end me.
---
## JANOS:
The brain.
---
## JUSTINE:
The heart.
---
## JANOS:
Yes.
---
## JANOS:
The wise thing.
--

## JUSTINE:
The wisest of things.
---
## JANOS:
Forgive me, Justine.
---
## JUSTINE:
What?
---
## JANOS:
I ask only that you help her.
---
## &nbsp;
Please.
---
## JUSTINE:
Wait. Wait. Why?
---
## JANOS:
I don’t…
---
## JUSTINE:
Janos.
---
## &nbsp;
Why?
---
## JANOS:
You’re extraordinary.
---
## &nbsp;
I want you to show the
world how extraordinary
---
## &nbsp;
you truly are.
---
---
## &nbsp;
You should never have
put me in that cage.
---
template: noise
sinister discordant music
---
---
## JUSTINE:
To market, to market.
---
## &nbsp;
To buy me a pig.
---
## &nbsp;
Home again, home again.
---
## &nbsp;
Jiggity-jig.
---
## MARIA:
What?
---
## JUSTINE:
Life endures.
---
## &nbsp;
That plant in its native soil
---
## &nbsp;
would survive with no one to tend it.
---
## &nbsp;
Grow, die. Grow again,
---
## &nbsp;
year after year.
---
## &nbsp;
Perpetual rebirth.
---
## MARIA:
My God.
---
## JUSTINE:
I’m in the spring again
having emerged from the winter.
---
## &nbsp;
I endured.
---
## MARIA:
Justine?
---
## JUSTINE:
Moritz.
---
## MARIA:
What?
---
## JUSTINE:
My last name. I only
recently remembered it.
---
## &nbsp;
Justine Moritz.
---
## &nbsp;
It is lovely. Don’t you think?
---
## MARIA:
What do you want?
---
## JUSTINE:
I asked you a question.
---
## MARIA:
What?
---
## JUSTINE:
Do you think my name is lovely?
---
## MARIA:
Yes.
---
## JUSTINE:
As do I. It sounds like an elegant dance,
---
## &nbsp;
or a style of music.
---
## &nbsp;
Moritz. Moritz Moritz Moritz.
---
## MARIA:
Are you well?
---
## JUSTINE:
Do you care?
---
## MARIA:
Of course I do.
---
## JUSTINE:
It would’ve been an
easier thing to believe, had you not…
---
## &nbsp;
well, you know.
---
## MARIA:
It was a mistake.
---
## JUSTINE:
Was it?
---
## MARIA:
Of course.
---
## &nbsp;
I was desperate.
---
## &nbsp;
You don’t understand,
---
## &nbsp;
when you feel death is at your shoulder…
---
## JUSTINE:
I was hanged, you know.
---
## MARIA:
What?
---
## JUSTINE:
Oh. Yes.
---
## &nbsp;
In my life before this life.
---
## &nbsp;
Hanged for the murder of a 5-year old boy,
---
## &nbsp;
William.
---
## &nbsp;
A little boy who I’d helped raise
---
## &nbsp;
since the day he was he born.
---
## MARIA:
Did you?
---
## JUSTINE:
Oh. No.
---
## &nbsp;
Another man. This stranger,
---
## &nbsp;
he got William in the woods and did him in,
---
## &nbsp;
and then he placed Wiliam’s
locket among my things and…
---
## &nbsp;
no trial, no compassion.
---
## &nbsp;
Just an angry mob and a rope.
---
## &nbsp;
And that is how my first life ended, Maria.
---
## &nbsp;
Swinging back and forth above the ground
---
## &nbsp;
and wondering why.
---
## MARIA:
I’m sorry.
---
## JUSTINE:
Oh? Did you tie the noose?
---
## MARIA:
No, only…
---
## &nbsp;
for something like that to happen
---
## &nbsp;
to any innocent woman.
---
## JUSTINE:
Innocent?
---
## &nbsp;
Is that what I am?
---
## &nbsp;
Vystario is dead.
---
## MARIA:
No.
---
## &nbsp;
Oh God. No.
---
## JUSTINE:
Yes. I’m afraid so.
---
## &nbsp;
He freed me in the hopes
that I would return to you.
---
## &nbsp;
Home again, home again.
---
## MARIA:
You killed him for that?
---
## JUSTINE:
No. I killed him for
thinking for even one moment
---
## &nbsp;
that he had the right to enslave me.
---
## MARIA:
I never told him to do that!
---
## JUSTINE:
What did you think he would do?
---
## &nbsp;
Dine me? Romance me?
---
## &nbsp;
Cajole me into joining his troupe?
---
## &nbsp;
For months I lived in a cage.
---
## &nbsp;
You put me in there as surely as he did!
---
## MARIA:
Forgive me. Justine I...
---
## JUSTINE:
Should I forgive you, Maria?
---
## &nbsp;
Would you forgive someone
who left you imprisoned?
---
## MARIA:
But what am I if not imprisoned?
---
## &nbsp;
I see the world the world around me.
---
## &nbsp;
I yearn to walk in the woods…
---
## &nbsp;
all this has been taken from me.
---
## JUSTINE:
And now you’re miracle
elixir has returned.
---
## &nbsp;
For that is all I am to you, yes?
---
## &nbsp;
Not a companion,
---
## &nbsp;
not a friend, a source of salvation.
---
## MARIA:
That isn’t true.
---
## JUSTINE:
You sold me.
---
## &nbsp;
Like I was some brood-mare at market!
---
## MARIA:
You say you killed Janos.
---
## &nbsp;
Am I to be next?
---
## JUSTINE:
An excellent question.
---
## MARIA:
Did I not rescue you from oblivion all those months ago?
---
## JUSTINE:
That debt has been more than repaid.
---
## MARIA:
Lost in an endless sleep
for over a hundred years.
---
## &nbsp;
That is how I found you.
---
## &nbsp;
How many centuries more
would you have laid there,
---
## &nbsp;
were it not for me?
---
## JUSTINE:
So you are my savior then?
---
## &nbsp;
The patron saint of monsters?
---
## MARIA:
No I am the person who wronged you.
---
## &nbsp;
A fallible human.
---
## JUSTINE:
There is a chasm between us.
---
## &nbsp;
You are human. I am nature.
---
## &nbsp;
This is what I learnt these past months.
---
## &nbsp;
Humans lie to themselves incessantly.
---
## &nbsp;
Nature…nature has no need for such lies.
---
## &nbsp;
Nature exists purely as it is.
---
## &nbsp;
It is time I do the same.
---
## MARIA:
What does that mean?
---
## JUSTINE:
You once offered me a home
in this castle of yours.
---
## &nbsp;
Does that offer still stand?
---
## MARIA:
What?
---
## JUSTINE:
I know. I have already
taken some of your clothes
---
## &nbsp;
but I’ve been traveling
in whatever I could find.
---
## MARIA:
Are you saying...
---
## JUSTINE:
I know great deal
has happened between us
---
## &nbsp;
but past concerns are not nature’s way.
---
## MARIA:
You would stay here?
---
## &nbsp;
With me?
---
## JUSTINE:
If you will have me.
---
## MARIA:
Yes. Of course.
---
## &nbsp;
I cannot thank you enough.
---
## JUSTINE:
No need.
---
## MARIA:
I am afraid I am still not of service.
---
## &nbsp;
I cannot cook or make your room.
---
## JUSTINE:
I am perfectly capable
of doing this for myself.
---
## MARIA:
Of course you are.
---
## &nbsp;
Where is my mind?
---
## &nbsp;
You shall have access to everything.
---
## &nbsp;
All of my books, my
epitheories, my research.
---
## JUSTINE:
Excellent.
---
## &nbsp;
This is what I want more
than anything in the world.
---
## &nbsp;
I want to learn.
---
## MARIA:
That mind of yours still
absorb all it touches. Yes?
---
## JUSTINE:
Just so. But it is not enough.
---
## &nbsp;
I have experienced many
things in my travels but it is not enough.
---
## &nbsp;
There is much
here for me. Very very much.
---
## MARIA:
We shall unravel this together.
---
## &nbsp;
This disease cannot stand
against our combined intellect.
---
## JUSTINE:
Excuse me?
---
## MARIA:
We shall get back to work
---
## &nbsp;
on your blood samples immediately.
---
## &nbsp;
I know in my soul that
the answer lies there.
---
## JUSTINE:
Ah. I see.
---
## &nbsp;
I’m afraid you misunderstand me.
---
## &nbsp;
I will not kill you Maria,
---
## &nbsp;
but neither will save you.
---
## MARIA:
What?
---
## &nbsp;
I invited you into my home.
---
## JUSTINE:
In truth I doubt I could
help you even if we tried.
---
## MARIA:
I have given you shelter and freedom.
---
## JUSTINE:
No. There is nothing in this world
---
## &nbsp;
that I need shelter from.
---
## &nbsp;
And freedom? Let me be
clear on this, Doctor.
---
## &nbsp;
Since the day that I
awoke in that ruined lab,
---
## &nbsp;
I have been free.
---
## &nbsp;
You and Vystario tried to rob me of that.
---
## MARIA:
If you mean to just watch me expire
---
## &nbsp;
like some…vulture, then leave this place.
---
## JUSTINE:
No I don’t think I will.
---
## MARIA:
I don’t...
---
## JUSTINE:
You need to stop fighting me Maria.
---
## &nbsp;
I am nature.
---
## &nbsp;
I am unstoppable.
---
## &nbsp;
Do we understand each other?
---
## MARIA:
You are a monster.
---
## JUSTINE:
Perhaps.
---
## &nbsp;
But consider this.
---
## &nbsp;
You had to months to
work with doctor’s notes, and with my blood.
---
## &nbsp;
Months that yielded nothing.
---
## &nbsp;
You fought nature and lost.
---
## MARIA:
Nature is a monster as well.
---
## JUSTINE:
And now you are beginning to understand.
---
## &nbsp;
Let me tell you what lies
ahead for the two of us.
---
## MARIA:
If you won’t help me I
will not abide your presence.
---
## JUSTINE:
There will be a period of adjustment.
---
## &nbsp;
Brandy?
---
## &nbsp;
What is vital for you to understand
---
## &nbsp;
is that you are no longer the mistress of this castle.
---
## &nbsp;
I am.
---
## MARIA:
I think the deed may disagree with you.
---
## JUSTINE:
The deed reads Maria von Moos, yes?
---
## &nbsp;
That is who is speaking to you now.
---
## MARIA:
What?
---
## JUSTINE:
I learnt a great many things about you
---
## &nbsp;
in my travels with Janos.
---
## &nbsp;
How seldom you leave this place,
---
## &nbsp;
how few people even know who you are.
---
## &nbsp;
Even your colleagues at
the Natural Research Society.
---
## &nbsp;
Paying a man to pretend to be you?
---
## MARIA:
You cannot take what is mine.
---
## JUSTINE:
You cannot stop me.
---
## &nbsp;
I will care for you, I will tend you.
---
## &nbsp;
As things get worse, I will be there.
---
## &nbsp;
And when you pass, which is
unfortunate but unavoidable,
---
## &nbsp;
I will bury you in the woods
---
## &nbsp;
where you may feed the
plants you love so dearly.
---
## MARIA:
No.
---
## JUSTINE:
There will be no funeral, no mourners.
---
## &nbsp;
For you see, Maria von Moos will carry on.
---
## &nbsp;
She will advance science,
---
## &nbsp;
she will entertain guests,
---
## &nbsp;
she will travel the world.
---
## &nbsp;
Mistress of Salenegg Castle.
---
## MARIA:
People will know.
---
## JUSTINE:
Which people?
---
## &nbsp;
The neighbors you don’t have?
---
## &nbsp;
Your colleagues at the Society?
---
## &nbsp;
Oh. Dear old Reggie?
---
## &nbsp;
You removed yourself
long before you found me.
---
## &nbsp;
Perhaps I should thank you for that.
---
## MARIA:
You are insane.
---
## JUSTINE:
Hm. The brandy is good.
---
## &nbsp;
I will enjoy it here.
---
## &nbsp;
The learning, culture.
---
## &nbsp;
Should I manage to publish my research,
---
## &nbsp;
I will use the money to
restore this old estate
---
## &nbsp;
to its proper glory.
---
## MARIA:
If you simply help me,
---
## &nbsp;
I will leave all of this to you!
---
## &nbsp;
I will have the papers drawn up tomorrow.
---
## JUSTINE:
Maria, I cannot help you.
---
## &nbsp;
My father’s research gave you no answers
---
## &nbsp;
and he knew much more than I did.
---
## MARIA:
But, your blood. The substance...
---
## JUSTINE:
Was hope. Yes.
---
## &nbsp;
It wasn’t an answer.
---
## &nbsp;
Haven’t you learnt this by now?
---
## MARIA:
This my home!
---
## JUSTINE:
For now.
---
## &nbsp;
I meant what I said.
---
## &nbsp;
I will care for you.
---
## &nbsp;
You will be fed and cleaned
---
## &nbsp;
and helped on your final journey.
---
## &nbsp;
And then, I become your legacy…
---
## &nbsp;
A legacy of science
---
## &nbsp;
and learning.
---
## MARIA:
Please. I don’t want to die.
---
## JUSTINE:
I know.
---
## &nbsp;
I know.
---
## &nbsp;
But if it is of any solace,
---
## &nbsp;
your death will teach me so much.
---

---
---
## JUSTINE:
To my most distinguished friends of
---
## &nbsp;
the Graubünden’s Natural Research Society,
---
## &nbsp;
I apologize for my lateness in this reply.
---
## &nbsp;
Please know that I have
received your message
---
## &nbsp;
but my illness kept me
from a prompt response.
---
## &nbsp;
I am overjoyed to report
that I have achieved
---
## &nbsp;
a breakthrough in my research.
---
## &nbsp;
And my malady has now
left me, for good and for all.
---
## &nbsp;
If I may, I would like to
discuss these findings with you
---
## &nbsp;
at your meeting in the new year.
---
## &nbsp;
I know I have never attended these
---
## &nbsp;
ostentatious gatherings before,
---
## &nbsp;
but what is a new year if
not the embodiment of change?
---
## &nbsp;
And before I arrive, I
must make a confession.
---
## &nbsp;
The man you met four
years ago at my induction
---
## &nbsp;
was not in fact M. von Moos.
---
## &nbsp;
He was a charlatan masquerading as me.
---
## &nbsp;
The reason for this deception is this:
---
## &nbsp;
“M. von Moos” is in fact “Maria von Moos”. 
---
## &nbsp;
Indeed, your most mysterious
member is a woman.
---
## &nbsp;
While some of this august society
---
## &nbsp;
may demand my expulsion,
---
## &nbsp;
I strongly suggest you allow
me to attend the meeting
---
## &nbsp;
and present my research.
---
## &nbsp;
If I may be so immodest,
---
## &nbsp;
I think the membership will
find it nothing short of…
---
## &nbsp;
…revolutionary.
---
## &nbsp;
My dear colleagues,
---
## &nbsp;
we are embarking on era of
---
## &nbsp;
unprecedented scientific achievement.
---
## &nbsp;
With each new discovery
---
## &nbsp;
we light a candle against
the shadow of ignorance
---
## &nbsp;
and superstition.
---
## &nbsp;
Let us put old ways of thinking aside
---
## &nbsp;
and embrace the truth of nature.
---
## &nbsp;
Life is perpetual change.
---
## &nbsp;
Should we be any different?
---
## &nbsp;
I sincerely look forward to meeting you,
---
## &nbsp;
one and all,
---
## &nbsp;
Maria von Moos
