His shop has been furnishing
heads with hats since 1834.

That’s 31 years,

Since last Thursday,
Garbleton AND Prattle.

template: noise

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Quality head wear for men and women.

---

## KIT:
As you can see, it’s a cozy establishment.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
As though it has recently been expanded.

---

## KIT:
With shelves running
all the way to the ceiling.

---

## TWO:
Black and white tiles across the floor.

Mahogany panels upon the walls.

And gas lamps casting a rosy glow.

As you can see.

And upon it rests an enormous
golden cash register.

---

## KIT:
It’s not real gold.

Yes, it is.

---

## KIT:
No, it’s not.

---

## NED:
It could be gold.

It’s paint.

Mrs Prattle’s beloved Amazon Parrot.

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Boasting a bright, green body,
yellowish tint on her back

and belly, black beak, gold and yellow
iris, and cerulean throat feathers.

---

## ALL:
As you can see.

## KIT:
Here at Mr Garbleton’s shop, the

template: noise

---

## &nbsp;
Sorry, ma’am.

---

## &nbsp;
It’s, oh, so new.

---

## &nbsp;
Here at Garbleton and Prattle,
---
template: noise

---

## &nbsp;
Mr Dickens’ hat

---

## &nbsp;
occupies a place of honor,

---

## &nbsp;
looking out upon all the hats of humanity,
which he loves.

## TWO:
Blacksmiths and barristers.

## FOUR:
Orphans and artisans.

And here is where our story begins,

---

## &nbsp;
in London, December 21st, 1865,

---

## &nbsp;
the longest night of the year.

---

template: noise

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Ned, be careful with that.

---

## KIT:
Mrs Prattle is hoping to close up early,
so she and

---

## &nbsp;
Well, you’ll see.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
How many times have I told
you not to clutch the bonnets?

---

## NED:
Seven.

---

## &nbsp;
No, eight.

---

## MRS.PRATTLE:
The question was rhetorical.

---

## NED:
Does that mean the answer is not a number?

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
It means an answer’s not required.

---

## &nbsp;
There. Now, gently, please.

---

template: noise

---

## &nbsp;
Where on earth could Lady Plume be?

---

## NED:
If she were here, ma’am, I could tell you.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
That question was rhetorical, too.

---

## MR. GARBLETON:
Lettie, my Oh, sorry, Ned.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Why are you not dressed yet?

---

## MR. GARBLETON:
I’m trying, but

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Our train leaves in 45 minutes.

---

## MR. GARBLETON:
The fact is,
my new waistcoat’s lost a button.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Impossible.

---

## &nbsp;
I made it myself.

---

## MR. GARBLETON:
All the same.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Don’t move.

---

## &nbsp;
I’ll stitch it up right where you stand.

---

## &nbsp;
Ned?

---

## &nbsp;
Did you feed Victoria?

---

template: noise
bird sounds

---

## NED:
Yes, ma’am.

---

## VICTORIA:
Feed Victoria.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Did you really?

---

## NED:
Yes, ma’am.

---

## VICTORIA:
Feed Victoria.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
She seems to think otherwise.

---

## NED:
I know I did,
because she tried to bite my pinkie off.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Don’t be ridiculous, Ned.

---

## &nbsp;
Victoria’s gentle as a pea hen,
aren’t you, chick, chick?

---

## &nbsp;
Chick, chick, chick.

---

## NED:
I can show you the beak mark if you

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Don’t make up stories.

---

## &nbsp;
You must’ve forgotten, so feed her now.

---

## NED:
But, ma’am, I…

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Go.

---

## VICTORIA:
Feed Victoria.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Tell Kit to bring up Lady Plume’s hat.

---

## &nbsp;
You know, I hate to say it, Cabbage,

---

## &nbsp;
but that boy’s brain
is porous as cheesecloth.

---

## MR. GARBLETON:
You might be a bit more patient with him.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
It’s hard to be patient
when one is in a rush.

---

## MR. GARBLETON:
It’s when one is in a rush
that one needs patience.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
You’re right, Cabbage.

---

## &nbsp;
Of course you’re right,
and I shall strive to be a mother to him.

---

## &nbsp;
Though the maternal odds
seem not to be native to me.

---

template: noise

---

## MR. GARBLETON:
There’s still time.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Did you call a carriage?

---

## MR. GARBLETON:
Well, they’re loading the suitcases.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Your new hat?

---

## MR. BARBLETON:
Here, on the counter.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Don’t forget it.

---

## &nbsp;
A hatmaker without a hat would be like

---

## &nbsp;
an engineer without a pocket protector.

---

## KIT:
Which won’t be invented till 1947.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
There, ready for the altar.

---



---

## MR. GARBLETON:
What would I do without you, Lettie?

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
One shudders to think.

---

## MR. GARBLETON:
No.

---

template: noise

---

## WITSLOW:
Good

---

## &nbsp;
eventide, ma’am.

---

## &nbsp;
Don’t mean to startle.

---

## &nbsp;
The name’s Witslow
of the London Constabulary.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
I was expecting someone else.

---

## WITSLOW:
Then I shall be brief.

---

## &nbsp;
I’ve entered the premises
merely to find out

---

## &nbsp;
whether a crime may be in progress.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
A crime?

---

## WITSLOW:
Preferably, a felony.

---

template: noise
bird squawks

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Oh, my.

---

## WITSLOW:
Well, if I may be perfectly frank,
the Chief Inspector

---

## &nbsp;
says it’s not sufficient
to keep the peace no more.

---

## &nbsp;
He wants arrests and convictions.

---

## &nbsp;
Keeps a running tally in his office.

---

## &nbsp;
At present, I’m on the verge of promotion.

---

## &nbsp;
Just one more felony and conviction,
and I’ll be bumped up to Inspector.

---


## MRS PRATTLE:
I’m not a legal expert, but I don’t
think I’ve witnessed any felonies.

---

## WITSLOW:
Murder’s the obvious one of course.

---

## &nbsp;
Plus high treason, and the four B’s.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
The four B’s?

---

## WITSLOW:
Burglary, bribery, blasphemy, bigamy.

---

## &nbsp;
Not to mention, your perjury,
forgery, robbery, housebreaking,

---

## &nbsp;
assault accompanied by wounding.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
I certainly hope we shan’t
fall victim to any of those.

---

## WITSLOW:
No one wants to be a victim, ma’am.

---

## &nbsp;
There’s nefarious persons about,
and we must be vigilant.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Then I shall be

---

template: noise
squeals

---

template: noise
bird squawks.

---

## &nbsp;
Vigilant also, Constable,
for your sake as well as the victims’.

---

## WITSLOW:
Much obliged.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Now, if you’ll excuse me.

---

template: noise

---

## &nbsp;
Kit, are you there?

---

## &nbsp;
Kit.

---

## &nbsp;
Where is that girl?

---

## FOUR:
That girl is here

---

## KIT:
Seven and six times ninety-eight

---

## FOUR:
In the basement of Garbleton.

---

## KIT:
Garbleton and Prattle.

---

## FOUR:
Sorry. Garbleton and Prattle.

---

## KIT:
is six hundred eighty-six, plus 
fourty-nine

---

## &nbsp;
Tallying up the days, and weeks,
and months that she must yet work here

---

## KIT:
Seven hundred thirty-five,
divided by twenty

---

## FOUR:
in order to buy her father’s
release from a Queen’s prison.

---

## KIT:
Equals £36.12 No. 15s.

---

## SIX:
He was confined there two years ago.

---

## WITSLOW:
For murder?

---

## SIX:
No.

---

## WITSLOW:
Oh.

---

## &nbsp;
Larceny by trick?

---

## SIX:
Not that either.

---

## WITSLOW:
Impersonating an officer of the law?

---

## SIX:
Sorry, not a felony.

---

## WITSLOW:
Oh.

---

## SIX:
Kit’s father was imprisoned for debt.

---

## TWO:
Wait, you mean he owed someone money?

---

## SIX:
Yes.

---

## TWO:
Was it a great deal of money?

---

## SIX:
No.

---

## TWO:
Can they do that?

---

## SIX:
They could.

---

## FOUR:
Kit was forced to leave school and work

---

## &nbsp;
for the so-called Debtor’s
Repayment Program.

---

## KIT:
so-called

---

## FOUR:
You’ll see.

---

## KIT:
Equals £31, 16s, and 16p, which is

---

## NED:
Will you read to me?

---

## KIT:
Hold on, Ned.

---

## &nbsp;
Which is

---

## NED:
Will you.

---

## KIT:
Ugh, just a minute.

---

## NED:
Everyone thinks I’m stupid.

---

## KIT:
You’re not.

---

## NED:
They think so.

---

## KIT:
Well, then they’re stupid.

---

## NED:
Are they?

---

## &nbsp;
Are they, Kit?

---

## KIT:
That’s 11 weeks.

---

## NED:
Why are you doing maths?

---

## &nbsp;
That’s less than three months.

---

## &nbsp;
Are you counting down the days
till you can leave me?

---

## KIT:
Don’t think of it that way, Ned.

---

## NED:
How can I not?

---

## KIT:
I’m going to get my father out of prison,
and then I can go back to school.

---

## NED:
You’re clever enough.

---

## KIT:
It’s not about being clever enough.

---

## NED:
Can you read to me now?

---

## KIT:
I promised your mother I wouldn’t,
not during working hours.

---

## NED:
She’s not my mother.

---
## KIT:
Stepmother then.

---

## NED:
Not that either.

---

## KIT:
She will be once they come home tomorrow.

---

## NED:
Anyway, we should be closed by now.

---

## KIT:
But we’re not.

---

## &nbsp;
Until we are, I can’t

---

## &nbsp;
Maybe just a few pages.

---

## NED:
_Great expectations_.

---

## KIT:
We just finished, _Great Expectations_.

---

## NED:
Can we start over?

---

## KIT:
No.

---

## &nbsp;
You pick another.

---

## NED:
_Little Dorrit_.

---

## KIT:
Oh no, not _Little Dorrit_ again.

---

## NED:
Why not?

---

## KIT:
I told you, remember.

---

## NED:
You said that “Mr Dickens
boys get to do things

---

## &nbsp;
whilst his girls only get
to be earnest and pure.”

---

## KIT:
See.

---

## &nbsp;
You are clever.

---

## &nbsp;
All right, let’s begin a new one,
shall we?

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Kit are you there?

---

## KIT:
What does she want now?

---

## NED:
Nothing. Just start.

---

## KIT:
Two pages.

---

## NED:
Three?

---

## KIT:
All right.

---

## &nbsp;
See,
this one is called “The Personal History

---

## &nbsp;
and Experience of David Copperfield,
the Younger”.

---

## NED:
That’s a long title.

---

## &nbsp;
Is it a long story?

---

## KIT:
Yes.

---

## NED:
Good.

---

## KIT:
Chapter one.

---
## &nbsp;
“I Am Born.”

---

## NED:
I like it already.

---

## KIT:
Shh.

---

## &nbsp;
“Whether I shall turn out
to be the hero of my own life,

---

## &nbsp;
or whether that station will be held
by anybody else these pages must show.”

---

## NED:
That’s very good.

---

## KIT:
Ned.

---

## NED:
Sorry.

---

## FOUR:
Meanwhile, upstairs.

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Lady Plume, at last.

template: noise

---

## &nbsp;
Good evening, Montague.

---

## &nbsp;
I was beginning to wonder
whether Is everything all right?

---

## LADY PLUME:
My dear Mrs Prattle, I’m simply astounded.

---

## &nbsp;
One might say flabbergasted.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Oh my.

---

## LADY PLUME:
Even thrown from the bone.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Is that an expression?

---

## LADY PLUME:
It should be.

---

## &nbsp;
What you have done
in combining Garbleton’s shop

---

## &nbsp;
with your own might render
a patron apoplectic.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
I hope in a good way.

---

## LADY PLUME:
Is there a good kind of apoplexy?

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Perhaps not.

---

## LADY PLUME:
I very much doubt it.

---

## &nbsp;
What in the name of fashion
could have compelled you

---

## &nbsp;
to take down the common wall
between you and Mr Garbleton,

---

## &nbsp;
and bring together a millinery
and a hatmaker’s shop.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
If I may be candid

---

## LADY PLUME:
Please do.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
It was love.

---

## LADY PLUME:
Oh.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
And a proposal of marriage.

---



---

## LADY PLUME:
Oh, my.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Having spent years as next door neighbors,

---

## &nbsp;
Mr Garbleton and I became friends,
companions in widowhood one might say,

---

## &nbsp;
following the death of Mrs Garbleton.

---

## LADY PLUME:
God rest her soul.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Six months later, my Mr Prattle.

---

## LADY PLUME:
God rest his soul.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
God rest his soul.

---

## &nbsp;
Then one day, I looked
at our shops side by side like groom

---

## &nbsp;
and bride, men’s hats in one,
ladies’ the other, and thought,

---

## &nbsp;
“Why shouldn’t they be conjoined?”

---

## &nbsp;
I said to him there and then Mr Garbleton,
tear down this wall.


---

## &nbsp;
He did.

---

## LADY PLUME:
How remarkable.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
We’re to be married
this very evening in Henley-on-Thames.

---

## &nbsp;
My people are very significant there.

---

## &nbsp;
Mr Garbleton’s rather nervous knowing
they’re prone to judgment.

---

## LADY PLUME:
The honeymoon?

---

template: noise
chuckling

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Just the night, I’m afraid.

---

## &nbsp;
Commerce never waits for Cupid.

---

## LADY PLUME:
Nor should it.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Yes. Pardon me just one moment.

---

## &nbsp;
You’d better not be reading that book.

---

## LADY PLUME:
My, what a novel device.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
The speaking tube.

---

## &nbsp;
Mr Garbleton had them installed,

---

## &nbsp;
inspired by romantic notions
of life in the Royal Navy.

---

## FOUR:
Also because the intercom wouldn’t
be invented for another 10 years.

---

## KIT:
To begin my life
with the beginning of my life,

---

## &nbsp;
I recall that I was born,
as I have been informed and believe,

---

## &nbsp;
on a Friday at twelve o’clock at night.

---

## &nbsp;
I was told that the clock began to strike,

---

## &nbsp;
and I began to cry simultaneously
in consideration of the

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
You’d better not be reading that book.

---

## KIT:
Does she have eyes that go round corners?

---

## NED:
Just read a little more.

---

## &nbsp;
She won’t know.

---

## SIX:
That book deserves an introduction.

---

## &nbsp;
Thanks.

---

## &nbsp;
Turn back time a year and a half.

---

## &nbsp;
As Mr Garbleton takes Kit aside.

---

## MR. GARBLETON:
You must be an avid reader, Kit.

---

## KIT:
Why do you say that, sir?

---

## MR. GARBLETON:
I found a pile of penny dreadfuls
hidden inside the coal bin.

---

## KIT:
I only read them when things are slow.

---

## MR. GARBLETON:
I’m sure you do.

---

## KIT:
I’ll stop if you want.

---

## MR. GARBLETON:
On the contrary.

---

## &nbsp;
In fact,
I’d like to lend you a book that ought

---

## &nbsp;
to reward your time and attention better.

---

## KIT:
Is it the Bible?

---

## MR. GARBLETON:
The Bible?

---

## KIT:
Because I’ve already read it,
even the boring parts.

---

## MR. GARBLETON:
Well then,
I think you might enjoy this even more.

---

## KIT:
Mr Dickens’ works?

---

## MR. GARBLETON:
All of his novels, at least to date.

---

## KIT:
How do they fit them all inside?

---

## MR. GARBLETON:
I don’t know,
the print’s very small as you can see.

---

## &nbsp;
There are pictures too here and there.

---

## KIT:
Where did you get such a wonderful thing?

---

## MR. GARBLETON:
It was a gift from a very old friend.

---

## KIT:
A very good friend I should think.

---

## MR. GARBLETON:
Oh yes.

---

## &nbsp;
You see, when I was about your age,

---

## &nbsp;
I worked in my father’s boot
blacking factory in Hungerford Stairs.

---

## &nbsp;
One day,
a boy called Charlie came into our employ.

---

## &nbsp;
His father, like yours,
was sitting in prison for debt,

---

## &nbsp;
and so the young gentleman,
as we called him then,

---

## &nbsp;
labored 10 hours each day
but the Lords at Piston Labels

---

## &nbsp;
on bottles of boot
black for which he was paid 6s a week.

---

## KIT:
Why, that’s less than I make.

---

## MR. GARBLETON:
This was 40 years ago.

---

## &nbsp;
Charlie was not made
for such toil for he had a quiet,

---

## &nbsp;
sensitive nature,
observant and quick like you.

---

## KIT:
Thank you, sir.

---

## MR. GARBLETON:
When he flagged
from the strain of the pace,

---

## &nbsp;
sometimes, I slipped in by his side,
and without a word, we labored together he

---

## &nbsp;
and I, and over time, became fast friends.

---

## &nbsp;
Being the seventh son of my father,
I saw I’d have no share in boot blacking,

---

## &nbsp;
so I apprenticed myself to a hatmaker,
and here we are.

---

## KIT:
Did Charlie’s father
ever get out of prison?

---

## MR. GARBLETON:
He did.

---

## KIT:
That’s a relief.

---

## MR. GARBLETON:
As it turns out,

---

## &nbsp;
his son was destined for greater things.

---

## KIT:
Greater?

---

## &nbsp;
What, was the young gentleman Mr Dickens?

---

## MR. GARBLETON:
Only Master Dickens then.

---

## &nbsp;
Who knew he had so many words in him?

---

## &nbsp;
You must never judge
a book by its binding,

---

## &nbsp;
Kit, as I know some have judged
you and your father.

---

## &nbsp;
A cover conceals more than it reveals.

---

## KIT:
Beneath our hats, we are all the same.

---

## MR. GARBLETON:
Indeed.

---

## &nbsp;
That is why this hat means so much to me,
and this book.

---

## &nbsp;
Both are reminders to never
dismiss another person

---

## &nbsp;
no matter how rough
their outside may seem.

---

## KIT:
I shall take very good care of it, sir.

---

## MR. GARBLETON:
I know you will, Kit.

---

## &nbsp;
I know you will.

---

## SIX:
Jump ahead a year and a half,
and Lady Plume is still waiting.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Kit, bring up Lady Plume’s hat at once.

---

## &nbsp;
Forgive me.

---

## &nbsp;
I do hope this new hat will make

---

## &nbsp;
an impression
wherever you chose to wear it.

---

## LADY PLUME:
It will make its debut
this very evening at St James’s Palace

---

## &nbsp;
when at last I shall meet Her Majesty.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Oh, my.

---

## LADY PLUME:
As you know, she’s been
in mourning these past four years ever

---

## &nbsp;
since her beloved Albert
passed beyond the veil.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
God rest his soul.

---

## LADY PLUME:
God rest his soul.

---

## VICTORIA:
God rest his soul.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Quiet, Victoria.

---

template: noise
dog barking

---

## LADY PLUME:
Hush, Monty.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
You were saying?

---

## LADY PLUME:
As a result, a royal sighting
is as rare now as a winter swallow.

---

## &nbsp;
If any event occasioned a new hat,
not just any that mind you,

---

## &nbsp;
but a work of art by Mrs Prattle

---



---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
You flatter me, Lady Plume.

---

## LADY PLUME:
I never flatter, and rarely praise.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Ah, here is Kit.

---

## &nbsp;
What took you so long?

---

## KIT:
I had trouble finding the proper box.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Let me guess,
it was hidden beneath a book?

---

## KIT:
I’m very sorry to keep you waiting,
my Lady.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
You kept us both waiting.

---

## KIT:
Yes, ma’am.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Well, don’t stand there drooping.

---

## &nbsp;
Write up Her Ladyship’s
receipt so she can be on her way.

---

## MR. GARBLETON:
Lettie, I can’t seem to find it

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Oh my heavens, what now?

---

## MR. GARBLETON:
Forgive me, Your Ladyship.

---

## &nbsp;
Have you seen it?

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
What on earth are you talking about?

---

## MR. GARBLETON:
My cravate.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Oh, good gracious, Cabbage.

---

## MR. GARBLETON:
I’ve looked everywhere.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Evidently not.

---

## &nbsp;
How he ever survived two years
without a wife, I’ll never know.

---

## LADY PLUME:
It’s the same with His Lordship,
believe me.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Pray excuse us.

---

## &nbsp;
The empire’s trains are never late,
though the empire’s subjects may be.

---

## LADY PLUME
Very true.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Come, Cabbage.

---

## MR. GARBLETON:
Oh, my hat.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
He’d forget his head
if I didn’t remind him.

---

## KIT:
I do hope Your Ladyship will be pleased.

---

## &nbsp;
Mrs Prattle’s worked hard on this one.

---

## LADY PLUME:
I have entrusted myself to her artistry
these many years and never regretted it.

---

## KIT:
I’m very pleased to hear that, my Lady.

---

## LADY PLUME:
I would have thought with a name like Kit,

---

## &nbsp;
that you would be a boy.

---

## KIT:
I’m not.

---

## LADY PLUME:
So I see.

---

## &nbsp;
I have a godson who’s named Christopher,
though the mother calls him Kit.

---

## &nbsp;
Is your Kit short for anything?

---

## KIT:
Kitty, which is short for Kate,
which is short for Katherine.

---

## LADY PLUME:
Katherine is a beautiful name.

---

## &nbsp;
I have a goddaughter
who’s called Katherine.

---

## &nbsp;
Why don’t you use that name?

---

## KIT:
Oh well,
we couldn’t afford the extra letters.

---

template: noise
chuckling

---

## LADY PLUME:
Oh.

---

## TWO:
This wasn’t true of course.

---

## &nbsp;
Kit’s Father,

---

## TWO/THREE/FOUR/SIX:
The prince of Queen’s prison.

---

## TWO:
Dubbed her Kit at an early age saying

---

## FATHER:
She may be compact,
but she is filled with useful things.

---

## TWO:
Like a shaving kit.

---

## &nbsp;
Or a first aid kit.

---

## FOUR:
Which won’t be invented
for another 20 years.


---

## TWO/THREE/FOUR/SIX:
In case of railroad emergencies.

---

template: noise
train whistles

---

## TWO:
Among the useful things
contained in this kit are

---

## FOUR:
A fondness for intricate
puzzles and games.

---

## TWO:
A facility with words and numbers.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Although her penmanship is smudgy.

---

## FOUR:
And an almost encyclopedic
knowledge of birds

---

## &nbsp;
she’s never seen based
on their feathers alone.

---

## KIT:
Would Your Ladyship
like to check my figures?

---

## TWO:
At this very moment, the doorbell

---

template: noise

---

jingles.

---

## &nbsp;
Kit looks up to notice two men
on the payroll of Queen’s Prison.

---

## KIT:
Mr Fleece.

---

## TWO:
One of them wears a black eyepatch,
a souvenir from a childhood brawl.

---

## FLEECE:
You should have seen the other child.

---

## TWO:
His companion walks with a limp.

---



---

## GNAT:
I was the other child.

---

## TWO:
They are here to hatch a scheme.

---

## &nbsp;
A plan so foul, so heinous,
so contemptible.

---

## FLEECE:
We can take it from here.

---

## TWO:
Oh, okay.

---

template: noise
dog barking

---

## LADY PLUME:
There now, Monty.

---

## FLEECE:
What a pleasant dog.

---

template: noise

---

---

## LADY PLUME:
Hush. He’s usually
very good with strangers.

---

## FLEECE:
Well, we all have an off day sometimes.

---

## &nbsp;
Do you see it, Gnat?

---

## GNAT:
See what?

---

## FLEECE:
It. The hat.

---

## GNAT:
It’s a hat shop.

---

## FLEECE:
The one above all others.

---

## &nbsp;
The ne plus ultra of hats.

---

## GNAT:
You know I don’t speak German.

---

## FLEECE:
There, on the stand above the stall.

---

## GNAT:
That ol’ thing?

---

## FLEECE:
Don’t point.

---

## GNAT:
Looks like something somebody cast
aside when they had a proper one made.

---

## FLEECE:
Indeed, but cast aside by whom?

---

## &nbsp;
Therein lies the difference
between trash and treasure.

---

## GNAT:
Treasure.

---

## FLEECE:
The reason that I shall soon retire

---

## &nbsp;
as Chief Warder of Queen’s Prison,
and tender my keys to you.

---

## GNAT:
Wait, I thought you said
you was coming into some money.

---

## FLEECE:
Oh I am, Gnat.

---

## &nbsp;
I am.

---

## &nbsp;
Here’s precisely how it will happen.

---

## COUNTESS:
Ne nous dérangez pas jusqu’à 
ce que je vous appelle!

---

## FLEECE:
There is a French Countess
who lives in exile just outside of London

---

## COUNTESS:
Ah, Monsieur Fleece.

---

## FLEECE:
For who I have acquired
some valuable items over the years.

---

## COUNTESS:
Ceçi est une phrase qui n’existe que 
pour dire quelque chose en français.

---



---

## FLEECE:
Et cette phrase aussi, Madam le Countess.

---

## GNAT:
I hope she speaks English as well.

---

## FLEECE:
Just wait.

---

## COUNTESS:
You know that I am a great
collector of beautiful things.

---

## FLEECE:
I have collected some of them for you.

---

## COUNTESS:
I have never revealed
to you my greatest collection,

---

## &nbsp;
the one I treasure above all others.

---

## FLEECE:
I shall be pleased to know it.

---

## COUNTESS:
And so, you shall.

---

## &nbsp;
Venez!

---

## FLEECE:
Here, she set her hand
upon a bookcase which swiveled about,

---

## &nbsp;
revealing a secret room.

---

## GNAT:
Just like in the movies.

---

## THREE:
Which won’t be invented
for another 30 years.

---



---

## FLEECE:
Stepping inside, I soon was surrounded by

---

## &nbsp;
Hats, my Lady?

---

## COUNTESS:
Not just any hats mon chere Fleece.

---

## &nbsp;
The headwear of the world’s
most illustrious writers.

---

## &nbsp;
Regarde.

---

## &nbsp;
Here is Voltaire’s famous school cap.

---

## &nbsp;
Goethe’s broad-brimmed hat.

---

## &nbsp;
The Wellington of Sir Walter Scott.

---

## &nbsp;
Even the Brontë’s bonnets.

---

## &nbsp;
Charlotte, Emily, Anne, et Branwell.

---

## FLEECE:
I believe Branwell Brontë was a man,
milady.

---

## COUNTESS:
I know.

---



---

## &nbsp;
There are two dozen others,
as you can see.

---

## &nbsp;
Poets, novelists, essayists,

---

## &nbsp;
but you will notice
the empty stand at the top.

---

## &nbsp;
A vacancy waiting to be filled.

---

## &nbsp;
My crowning achievement, one might say.

---

## FLEECE:
That is reserved for?

---

## COUNTESS:
The top hat of Monsieur Charles Dickens,
the greatest novel writer

---

## &nbsp;
in Europe.

---



---

## FLEECE:
Believe me. I’m familiar.

---

template: noise
coughs

---

## COUNTESS:
Can you get it for me?

---

## FLEECE
The hat of Mr Dickens?

---

## COUNTESS:
I must have it.

---

## FLEECE:
It might be costly.

---

## COUNTESS:
You know my resources.

---

## FLEECE:
Dangerous even.

---

## COUNTESS:
Name your price.

---

## FLEECE:
I did.

---

## GNAT:
That was?

---

## FLEECE:
None of your business.

---

## COUNTESS:
Then we have a deal.

---

## &nbsp;
As they say in Nouvelle York,
how soon can you get it?

---

## FLEECE:
Within the week.

---

## COUNTESS:
Magnifique.

---

## &nbsp;
Promise you won’t harm
a hair on the great man’s head.

---

## &nbsp;
We need more stories from him.

---

## FLEECE:
He will never know what he has lost,
my Lady.

---

## GNAT:
This is that hat?

---

## FLEECE:
This is that very hat.

---

## KIT:
That hat deserves an introduction.

---

## THREE:
Turn back the hands of time six months.

---

## KIT:
Mr Dickens rides a Southeastern
railway train from Folkestone.

---

template: noise
train whistles

---

## &nbsp;
Returning from France
to his home in London.

---

## THREE:
From high up in a hot locomotive,

---

## &nbsp;
an old engineer spies a laborer
frantically waving a red flag.

---

## KIT:
The engineer whistles for breaks

---

template: noise
train whistles

---

## &nbsp;
and reversed his engine,
but it’s too late.

---

## THREE:
For a length of track had been
removed from the Staplehurst Bridge,

---

## &nbsp;
and the train now hurtles into the void,

---

## &nbsp;
plunging down to the river below.

---

## KIT:
Mr Dickens manages to extricate
himself from the vast glass carriage.

---

template: noise
music

---

## THREE:
Surrounded now by the broken and bleeding,

---

## &nbsp;
he fills his hat from the river
and takes it round to the injured,

---

## KIT:
including
those from the second-class carriages.

---

## THREE:
For some,
it would be their last drink of water.

---

## KIT:
Naturally, he would need a replacement,

---

## &nbsp;
so Mr Dickens calls upon his old
companion from boot blacking days,

---

## &nbsp;
which is how the old hat winds
up here at Garbleton and Prattle.

---

template: noise

---

## FLEECE:
Where you and I will steal it tonight.

---

## GNAT:
Me?

---

## FLEECE:
Shh. Don’t shout.

---

## GNAT:
I’m not cut out for thievery.

---

## FLEECE:
All in a good cause, Gnat.

---

## &nbsp;
Tomorrow, I shall finally retire
from Queen’s Prison for good,

---

## &nbsp;
and you shall take
my place as Chief Warder,

---

## &nbsp;
with all the perquisites of the position.

---

## GNAT?
All the what?

---

## FLEECE:
Perquisites.

---

## &nbsp;
P-E-R-Q-U-I

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Well, tell them to hold their horses.

---

## &nbsp;
Literally.

---

## &nbsp;
It’s everything satisfactory,
Your Ladyship?

---

## LADY PLUME:
You’ve never given me
any cause for complaint.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
I pray I never shall.

---

## &nbsp;
May Her Majesty smile
at you tonight at her royal levee.

---

## LADY PLUME:
May your very significant family smile
upon the groom tonight at your wedding.

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Ned, come up, it’s time to go.

---

## &nbsp;
Do these gentlemen
know we’re closing early?

---

## KIT:
I don’t think they’re shopping for hats,
ma’am.

---

## FLEECE:
My dear Mrs Prattle.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Mr Fleece, forgive me.

---

## &nbsp;
I am in a bit of a flurry.

---

## FLEECE:
All for good reason, I hope.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
We’re to be married this evening,
in Henley-on-Thames.

---

## FLEECE:
Felicitations.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
You’re here to pick up Kit’s wages,
no doubt?

---

## FLEECE:
Indeed,
and also to introduce you to my successor.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Successor?

---

## FLEECE:
This is Gnat,
my trusty associate at the prison.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Pleased to meet you, Nathaniel.

---

## GNAT:
Oh, no, not Nathaniel, ma’am, just Gnat.

---

## &nbsp;
The G at the front is silent.

---



---

## &nbsp;
G-N-A-T, like the tiny flies.

---



---

## &nbsp;
Irritating but non-threatening.

---



---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
My, what an interesting name.

---

## GNAT:
 There are better.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Does this mean
you have accepted another position?

---

## FLEECE:
Actually, no, ma’am.

---

## &nbsp;
I expect to come into a little money.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
You don’t say.

---

## &nbsp;
Did a wealthy relative give up the ghost?

---

## Fleece:
My uncle, Cecil, choked on a sausage.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Oh, how dreadful.

---

## FLEECE:
He died as he lived.

---

## &nbsp;
In any case, I thought Gnat
should know the ins and outs

---

## &nbsp;
of the Debtor’s Repayment Program.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
I think I may have the money right here.

---

template: noise

---

## FLEECE:
Seven and six.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Of course.

---

## KIT:
Only 11 weeks left, Mr Fleece.

---

## FLEECE:
What’s that?

---

## KIT:
Until we’re all paid up.

---

## FLEECE:
I’ll have to check my records.

---

## KIT
Could you check now?

---

## &nbsp;
You’ve got your little red book.

---

## FLEECE:
Another time perhaps,
when your employer is not in a flurry.

---

## KIT:
But you

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Don’t press the matter, Kit.

---

## &nbsp;
He’s quite right.

---

## FLEECE:
I wish you all the best in your new life,
madam.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
And I in yours.

---



---

template: noise

---

## GNAT:
Debtor’s Repayment Program?

---

## FLEECE:
I mentioned perquisites, didn’t I?

---

## GNAT:
I don’t even know what that means.

---

## NED:
You’re leaving then?

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Later than I should like.

---

## &nbsp;
Now, where is Mr Garbleton?

---

## MR. GARBLETON:
Coming, Lettie.

---

## &nbsp;
I am on my way to you in marriage,
on my way to you.

---

---

## &nbsp;
Now I cannot seem to locate my spectacles.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
You’re wearing them.

---

## MR. GARBLETON:
Oh, yes, so I am.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Make sure to lock the front
doors when Kit leaves.

---

## NED:
Yes, ma’am.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
We’ll come back by first train tomorrow.

---

## KIT:
Wait.

---

## &nbsp;
You mean, Ned’s not going with you.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Don’t be silly, child.

---

## &nbsp;
Whatever would he do at a wedding?

---

## &nbsp;
Be perfectly bored, I am sure of it.

---

## MR. GARBLETON:
You are to be snug in the basement, Ned.

---

## &nbsp;
There’s plenty of coal.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
No need to waste it.

---

## MR. GARBLETON:
When you next see us,
you’ll have a new mother.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Now, off we go to Charing Cross.

---

## &nbsp;
To Charing Cross.

---

## &nbsp;
You keep on Chick Chick,
mommy will be home soon.

---

## VICTORIA:
Feed Victoria.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Yes, of course.

## &nbsp;
Ned, you won’t forget?

## MR. GARBLETON:
Lettie.

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Coming, Cabbage.

## &nbsp;
Gracious, we’ve got to get out of here.

## VICTORIA:
Get out of here.

## SIX:
Down the street and around the corner,
just on the edge of hearing

---

## NED:
I miss my mother.

---

## KIT:
Me too.

---

## NED:
I don’t want the new one.

---

## KIT:
I know.

---

## NED:
She’s embarrassed by me.

---

## &nbsp;
That’s why I wasn’t asked
to the wedding tonight,

---

## &nbsp;
so she needn’t introduce
me to her fancy relations.

---

## KIT:
You’ll warm up to each other in time.

---

## &nbsp;
Just wait and see.

---

## &nbsp;
I’ll see you tomorrow.

---

## NED:
Can you stay?

---

## KIT:
Stay?

---

## NED:
With me.

---

## &nbsp;
I don’t want to be here all by myself.

---

## KIT:
You won’t be alone.

---

## &nbsp;
You’ve got Victoria.

---

## VICTORIA:
Feed Victoria.

---

## NED:
She doesn’t like me.

---

## KIT:
I’m sure she does.

---

## NED:
Maybe the taste of me.

---

## KIT:
She’s just hungry.

---

## &nbsp;
She’ll be happier once you feed her.

---

## VICTORIA:
Feed Victoria.

---

## NED:
Stop talking.

---

## VICTORIA:
Stop talking.

---

## KIT:
Or I can feed her if you prefer.

---

## NED:
I prefer that you’d stay.

---

## KIT:
Ned.

---

## NED:
We could stay up all night
reading David Copperfield

---

## &nbsp;
until the sun comes up,
and then it won’t be dark anymore.

---

## KIT:
I’ll have to stop by the prison first.

---

## NED:
Why?

---

## KIT:
To let my father know I won’t be
with him or he’ll be lonely.

---

## NED:
You’ll say with me then?

---

## KIT:
Yes, I’ll stay with you.

---

## NED:
Yes.

---

## VICTORIA:
Stop talking.

---

## KIT:
I’ll take my feather box with him.

---

## &nbsp;
That’ll cheer him up.

---

## NED:
I’ll get it for you.

---

## &nbsp;
Yes.

---

## KIT:
I think you will need to take a rest.

---

## &nbsp;
We’ll put your cover on.

---

## &nbsp;
You know what that means, don’t you?

---

## VICTORIA:
Feed Victoria.

---

## KIT:
No, the other one.

---

## VICTORIA:
God rest his soul.

---

## KIT:
Nice try, but no.

---

## VICTORIA:
Get out of here.

---

## KIT:
I’m trying, believe me.

---

## VICTORIA:
Stop talking.

---

## KIT:
Perfect.

---

## &nbsp;
I’ll see you in the morning.

## FIVE:
feather box beneath one arm.

And a blanket wrapped
about her as her only

defense against the cold.

She heads for Hungerford Bridge.

Once a graceful suspension walkway,

## &nbsp;
now a wrought iron cage
of criss-cross girders newly

## &nbsp;
built to corral those modern monsters,

## &nbsp;

of Charing Cross Station.

---

## THREE:
She has memorized the railway timetables

---

## FIVE:
Naturally.

---

## THREE:
And so knows when a girl may safely
cross the great expanse on foot.

---

## FIVE:
She does so now,
pausing in the middle to gaze out

---

## &nbsp;
through the latticework
to the river beneath.

---

## THREE:
It is dark.

---

## FIVE:
Darker than the night.

---

## THREE:
Darker than her mother’s grave,
she thinks.

---

## &nbsp;
Though she’d rather not.

Her reverie is broken by a distant rumble.

The rumbling of an engine

Steaming and screeching.

She scurries across before the monster
appears, and plunges into South London.

---

## FOUR:
In 29 minutes, she’s in Cell 34,

---

## TWO/THREE/FOUR/FIVE:
with her father,
“The Prince of Queen’s Prison”.

---

## FOUR:
A master shoe-buckle maker in an age
where nobody wants shoe buckles.

---

## &nbsp;
Thus,
his expenses have outpaced his income,

---

## &nbsp;
and now he lives here,
with the other debtors and their families,

---

## &nbsp;
along with the petty
thieves and pickpockets.

---

## KIT:
Father?

---

## FATHER:
It’s you, Kit.

---

## &nbsp;
I couldn’t see.

---

## &nbsp;
I thought, it must be the bucket man.

---

## KIT:
Why haven’t you lit your lantern?

---

## FATHER:
I was trying to save the oil
for when it gets dark.

---

## KIT:
If you cant see, it’s dark.

---

## &nbsp;
That’s what dark means.

---

## FATHER:
I meant winter dark.

---

## KIT:
It’s winter now.

---

## FATHER:
Already?

---

## KIT:
Since 6:49, this evening,
according to the almanac.

---

## FATHER:
Only 89 days till spring.

---



---

## KIT:
You shouldn’t sit in the dark.

---

## &nbsp;
It’ll dampen your spirit.

---

## FATHER:
I’d rather not see where I am.

---

## &nbsp;
In the dark,
I can picture myself in our little rooms

---

## &nbsp;
on Flower Street,
with a coal fire roaring,

---

## &nbsp;
and something meaty sizzling in the pan,
and Marjorie, that is your mother

---

## KIT:
Yes?

---

## FATHER:
Doing whatever she pleases.

---

## KIT:
That’s a good picture.

---

## &nbsp;
Hold onto that one.

---

## FATHER:
What are you holding onto there?

---

## KIT:
My box, the one I told you about.

---

## FATHER:
With the feathers?

---

## KIT:
Yes. Look.

---

## FATHER:
It’s like an aviary.

---


## KIT:
Mrs Prattle is just mad for feathers.

---

## &nbsp;
She puts them on everything now,
like the French.

---

## &nbsp;
When she walks through Trafalgar Square,
the pigeons, they just run the other way.

---

---

## FATHER:
Surely, you didn’t steal these, Kit?

## KIT:
No.

---

## &nbsp;
No, no,
she gives me the ones that are bent,

---

## &nbsp;
or broken, or otherwise worthless.

---

## &nbsp;
You see, that’s why I love them.

---

## FATHER:
What’s this one?

---

## KIT:
Ring-neck pheasant.

---

## &nbsp;
You can tell by those thin, black bars.

---

## FATHER:
This?

---

## KIT:
White-bellied swallow.

---

## FATHER:
This?

---

## KIT:
Guadelupe caracara.

---

## FOUR:
Which will, unfortunately,
be extinct by 1900.

---

## FATHER:
This?

---

## KIT:
Chatham bellbird.

---

Also gone.

## KIT:
New Zealand quail.

Sad, but true.

Laughing owl.

Not anymore.

I can almost hear them myself.

Where will you go?

---

## KIT:
Back to the shop.

---

## FATHER:
Not still working.

---

## KIT:
No, reading to Ned.

---

## &nbsp;
The Mr. and Mrs. are getting
married tonight,

---

## &nbsp;
and he’ll be all alone.

---

## FATHER:
Or I’ll be alone.

---

## KIT:
Well, it’s just for the night.

---

## &nbsp;
He’s very lonely because of the wedding.

---

## FATHER:
I thought he would’ve been with them.

---

## KIT:
Keep your lantern lit until curfew.

---

## &nbsp;
The flame will keep you company.

---

## FATHER:
You’ll get me out of here soon,
won’t you, Kit?

---

## KIT:
Very soon, father.

---

## FATHER:
I am not as sturdy as I was.

---

## KIT:
We’ll be walking
along the strands by spring.

---

## FATHER:
Another whole winter here then.

---

## KIT:
Not even.

---

## &nbsp;
Have faith.

---

## &nbsp;
Think about the birds.

---

## TWO:
Meanwhile, only one floor below,
the man with the limp and the man

---

## &nbsp;
with the eye-patch prepare to return
to the little hat shop on Cromwell Street.

---

## GNAT:
All I’m saying is I’ve been
having second thoughts.

---

## FLEECE:
How can you have second thoughts

---

## &nbsp;
when I’ve never noticed
you having a first?

---

## GNAT:
Well, what if something happens
here while we’re both gone?

---

## FLEECE:
All the prisoners
will be locked in their cells.

---

## &nbsp;
The front gate will be latched and bolted.

---

## &nbsp;
By my calculations, we’ll be out
and back in an hour-and-a-half.

---

## &nbsp;
Nothing happens in Queen’s Prison, Gnat.

---

## &nbsp;
That’s its purpose, to crush
a man’s spirit with utter boredom.

---

## &nbsp;
My father was sent here
for debt when I was only nine.

---

## &nbsp;
He’d sank all our cash in Peruvian silver
mines, which turned out not to exist.

---

## &nbsp;
My mother, sisters, and I moved in too.

---

## &nbsp;
Cheaper than renting
a room somewhere else.

---

## &nbsp;
The Governor, he saw that I had promise.

---

## &nbsp;
He took pity on me, gave me odd jobs.

---

## &nbsp;
After my father died,
he even made me a warder,

---

## &nbsp;
and then chief warder, master of the keys.

---

## &nbsp;
I have lived my entire life
between iron and stone.

---

## &nbsp;
Well, no more.

---

## &nbsp;
As of tomorrow,
I shall retire from Queen’s Prison

---

## &nbsp;
and turn over all my keys to you.

---

## GNAT:
With all the

---

## FLEECE:
Ah, yes, with all the what?

---

## Gnat:
Perkiness.

---

## FLEECE:
No, not quite, try it again.

---

## GNAT:
Percussionist.

---

## FLEECE:
Look, it’s not that hard.

---

## &nbsp;
The word is perquisites, all right?

---

## &nbsp;
Purposes.

---

## &nbsp;
Purposes.

---

## &nbsp;
Perks, for short.

---

## &nbsp;
None of them will be yours
unless we acquire that hat.

## &nbsp;
Lock the front gates.

It’s time to go shopping.

As Kit make her way to the gate,

---

## MOTHER
You work so hard.

---

I have to.

---

## MOTHER:
Your little fingers

I know.

Full of cuts and calluses.

---

## KIT:
It’s just till father is released.

---

## MOTHER:
You’re only a child, Katherine.

---

## &nbsp;
You shouldn’t have to carry
a family on your shoulders.

---

## KIT:
It’s only 11 weeks more,
and then father can go back to work.

---

## MOTHER:
Making shoe buckles.

---

## &nbsp;
When is the last time somebody held you?

---

## KIT:
I don’t remember.

---

## MOTHER:
Then I’ll hold you.

---

## KIT:
You’re not really here.

---

## MOTHER:
I am.

---

## GNAT:
What do you think you’re doing?

---

## KIT:
Oh.

---

## &nbsp;
Waiting for someone to open the gate.

---

## GNAT:
You won’t get back in.

---

## &nbsp;
I’m here to lock it tight for the night.

---

## KIT:
I’ll come back tomorrow.

---

## GNAT:
They say it’s nasty out there.

---

## &nbsp;
That thing all you got for a coat?

---

## KIT:
I don’t have to go far.

---

## GNAT:
Well,

---

## &nbsp;
may it keep out the cold.

---

## &nbsp;
Rather stay in myself tonight.

Meanwhile, in a stately church

in Henley-on-Thames, the choir prepares

union between widow and widower.

Back in London, far from the wedding,
the winter wind is bitter and deep.

Cat are rolling in the chimneys
and making slutty gutters grown.

Kit now makes her way
through Suffolk crossing back

---

## &nbsp;
over Hungerford Bridge,
not stopping this time to look

## &nbsp;
into the heart of the river, and scuttling

---

## &nbsp;
between the rails on her way
back to Garbleton and Prattle.

On the other side, the flickering
firelight glows in the windows,

## &nbsp;
but still, the snow falls heavily
and it swirls about in circles.

## TWO
Inside the church vestry,
Mrs. Prattle prepares

---

## &nbsp;
to become Mrs. Garbleton,
and Mr. Garbleton

---

## &nbsp;
prepares to meet
the very significant family of the bride.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Uncle Bart is the Undertaker,
Uncle Bert is the Bishop,

---

## &nbsp;
and Uncle Barth
is the mayor of Papplewick.

---

## &nbsp;
He’s the one whose wife has a very pinched
face like someone shut a door upon it.

---

## MR. GARBLETON:
I don’t know how I’ll ever
get the name straight.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Don’t be silly.

---

## &nbsp;
You nearly had them all down on the train.

---

## &nbsp;
Now let’s start from the top.

---

## &nbsp;
Who is Adelaide?

---

## MR. GARBLETON:
What is wrong with this waistcoat?

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
You’ve simply bunched up the buttons,
cabbage.

---

## &nbsp;
No wonder they pop.

---

## &nbsp;
Here, let me help you.

---

## &nbsp;
Now, now, you mustn’t be anxious.

---

## &nbsp;
They’re not as formidable as you suppose.

---

## &nbsp;
Well, perhaps they are, but you are sure
to pass with flying colors.

---

## &nbsp;
They just want to know that their little
Letitia is marrying a man of distinction.

---

## MR. GARBLETON:
Whoa.

---

## &nbsp;
Am I a man of distinction, Letty?

---

## Mrs. PRATTLE:
Beneath our hats, we are all the same.

---

## &nbsp;
Now, let’s put on your splendid new hat

---

## &nbsp;
so they can see how distinguished
my new husband is.

---

## FIVE:
Now in the basement, warm again,

---

## &nbsp;
Kit settles in with Ned,
along with their old friend, Mr. Dickens,

---

## &nbsp;
and their new one, Master Copperfield.

---

## &nbsp;
Four friends keeping
company on a frigid night.

---

## KIT:
I was born at Blundeston in Suffolk
or thereby as they say in Scotland.

---

## &nbsp;
I was a posthumous child.

---

## &nbsp;
My father did

---

## NED:
What’s a posthumous child?

---

## KIT:
I think it means his father
died before he was born.

---

## &nbsp;
My father’s eyes had closed
upon the light of this world

---

## &nbsp;
six months when mine opened on it.

---

## &nbsp;
See?

---

## NED:
It’s very sad.

---

## KIT:
There is something strange to me,
even now,

---

## &nbsp;
in the reflection that he never saw me.

---

## &nbsp;
Something stranger
still in the shadowy remembrances

---

## &nbsp;
I have of my childish
associations of his white gravestone

---

## &nbsp;
in the churchyard,
and the indefinable compassion

---

## &nbsp;
I used to feel for it,
lying out alone there in the dark night.

---

## &nbsp;
When our little parlor was
warm and bright with fire

---

## &nbsp;
and candle,
and the doors of our house were,

---

## &nbsp;
almost cruelly it seems to me sometimes,
bolted and locked against it.

---

## NED:
Are you all right, Kit?

---

## KIT:
Oh, yes.

---

## &nbsp;
There is something strange to me,
even now, in the

---

## NED:
You already read that.

---
## KIT:
Oh.

---

## &nbsp;
I did, Ned.

---

## &nbsp;
Where were we?

Outside the shop, a pair of carolers
finds some shelter inside the doorway.

the other with a black eyepatch.

## FLEECE:
Oh, curse those blasted carolers.

---

## &nbsp;
They got to take up residence
just outside the shop.

---

## GNAT:
You don’t like carols?

---

## FLEECE:
I don’t mind carols, it’s carolers I hate.

---

## CAROLERS:
SO REMEMBER THE POOR.

## FLEECE:
(applauding) Well done, splendid. Very festive.

## &nbsp;
Oh, yes, puts me right in the mood.

---

## &nbsp;
Yes, yes, thank you.

---

## &nbsp;
Say, you know who would love some carols?

---

## &nbsp;
There’s a motley group of orphans
just round the corner there.

---

## &nbsp;
I bet they could use a frothy song.

---

## CAROLER 1:
Orphans, you say, sir?

---

## FLEECE:
Yes, orphans.

---

## &nbsp;
Wretched, ragged, huge eyes.

---

## CAROLER 2:
Well, I suppose we could bring
them some cheer, aye, Fred?

---

## CAROLER 1:
Speaker My thoughts exactly, Bob.

---

## FLEECE:
Excellent.

---

## CAROLER 2:
Thanks for the tip, sir.

---

## CAROLER 1:
Thank you.

---

## FLEECE:
Any time.

---

## &nbsp;
God bless us, everyone.

---

## GNAT:
How did you know there was
orphans round the corner?

---

## FLEECE:
This is London, Gnat.

---

## &nbsp;
There’s always an orphan
when you need one.

---

## &nbsp;
Right, let’s see if that hat
is still where we want it.

---

## GNAT:
Why wouldn’t it be?

---

## FLEECE:
Who knows?

---

## &nbsp;
It’s worth a fortune.

---

## &nbsp;
They may lock it up at night.

---

## &nbsp;
Help me look.

---

## &nbsp;
Once we step over that threshold,
we could be jailed for housebreaking.

---

## &nbsp;
I want to make sure
that the benefit outweighs the risk.

---

## GNAT:
Well, I can’t see a thing.

---

## &nbsp;
The window is too crowded.

---

## FLEECE:
There’s a space at the top.

---

## &nbsp;
Let me climb on your back.

---

## GNAT:
What? No.

---

## FLEECE:
Well, we’ve got to make sure it’s there.

---

## GNAT:
Let me climb on you, then.

---

## FLEECE:
What? I’ve got a bad back.

---

## GNAT:
Well, I’ve got a bad leg.

---

## FLEECE:
Well, I’ve got a bad neck.

---

## GNAT:
I’ve got a bad leg.

## FLEECE:
You already said that.

---

## GNAT:
Both of them are very bad.

---

## FLEECE:
Oh, all right. Just make it quick.

---

template: noise

---

## &nbsp;
All right, Gnat, do you see it?

---

## GNAT:
Move me to the right.

---

## &nbsp;
No, no, no, my right.

---

template: noise
crowd laughs

---

## FLEECE:
My right is your right.

---

## GNAT:
I meant the left.

---

## FLEECE:
What? What is it?

---

## GNAT:
It’s hats.

---

## FLEECE:
Of course, there are hats.

---

## &nbsp;
It’s a hat shop, but do you see it;

---

## &nbsp;
the one at the top of the shop?

---

## GNAT:
Move me to the right.

---

## THREE:
Meanwhile,
in a chamber beside the Queen’s levy room

---

## &nbsp;
in St. James Palace,
Lady Plume 
---
template: noise

---

## &nbsp;
and her manservant, Styfflip,
make last-minute adjustments

---

## &nbsp;
to her accouterment
before she is presented to her majesty.

---

## LADY PLUME:
So many under-married girls here,

---

## &nbsp;
Styfflip, all dressed in white.

---

## &nbsp;
Such delicate roses fresh from the garden

---

## &nbsp;
can make one feel
like last month’s begonias.

---

## STYFFLIP:
Your ladyship is still the freshest
flower in the garden.

---

## LADY PLUME:
Oh, Styfflip.

---

## &nbsp;
You’re an inveterate flatterer.

---

## &nbsp;
Now, you know why I keep you in my employ.

---

## STYFFLIP:
Indeed, milady.

---

## LADY PLUME:
Wait till you see this hat.

---

## &nbsp;
I’m sure Mrs. Prattle has outdone herself.

---

## &nbsp;
I may have lost the blast
of youth I had at 19, but tonight,

---

## &nbsp;
this hat will bow to none
other than the Queen herself.

---

## THREE:
Outside the shop.

---

## GNAT:
Maybe to the right.

---

## &nbsp;
To the left.

---

## FLEECE:
Will you make up your mind?

---

## GNAT:
All right.

---

## &nbsp;
Oh.

---

## FLEECE:
What? What is it?

---

## GNAT:
I see it.

---

## FLEECE:
You’re sure?

---

## GNAT:
Dead certain.

---

## FLEECE:
Perfect.

---

## &nbsp;
Now, here’s what we’re going to do.

---

## &nbsp;
Now, I’ll go to work on that lock,
and you keep an eye on the street

---

## &nbsp;
and let me know if someone’s coming.

---

## GNAT:
Yes.

---

## &nbsp;
Someone’s coming.

---

## FLEECE:
Right.

---

## &nbsp;
Now, I’ll pretend to tie my shoelace.

---

## GNAT:
Someone’s coming.

---

## FLEECE:
No, you don’t have to keep saying it.

---

## GNAT:
Someone’s here.

---

## WITSLOW:
Good eventide, gentlemen,
or should I say “night”?

---

## FLEECE:
Constable, ever so glad to see you.

---

## WITSLOW:
Are you?

---

## GNAT:
Are we?

---

## FLEECE:
Such good timing.

---

## WITSLOW:
Why is that?

---

## GNAT:
Good question.

---

## FLEECE:
There is a crime in progress.

---

template: noise
whimpers

---

## WITSLOW:
What sort of crime?

---

## FLEECE:
Do you hear those carolers?

---

## WITSLOW:
Carolers?

---

## FLEECE:
Fa-la-la-la-la and all that.

---

## WITSLOW:
I’ve heard of carolers now and again.

---

## &nbsp;
I had a ringing tenor myself
when I was a younger man.

---

## FLEECE:
Is that so?

---

## WITSLOW:
As a baby in my prime

---

## FLEECE:
These particular carolers
are disturbing the peace.

---

## WITSLOW:
Disturbing the peace?

---

## FLEECE:
Tormenting the orphans.

---

## &nbsp;
Listen, you can hear them now.

---
template: song
## CAROLER:
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.

## FLEECE:
In a distance.

I only hear one.

Trust me, there are two.

## CAROLERS:
La-la-la-la-la-la-la.

---

## WITSLOW:
Oh, yes, I hear them now.

---

## &nbsp;
What a cheerful sound.

---

## FLEECE:
Indeed, no one loves a carol more than I,
but surely

---

## &nbsp;
there’s an ordinance on the books
about singing after hours.

---

## WITSLOW:
I might have to check.

---

## FLEECE:
Thank you.

---

## WITSLOW:
I can’t keep all the laws
in my back pocket.

---

## FLEECE:
Of course not.

---

## WITSLOW:
Though I doubt it’s a felony

---

## FLEECE:
No?

---

## WITSLOW:
More likely a misdemeanor
such as vagrancy,

---

## &nbsp;
common assault, minor riots,
drunk and disorderly conduct.

---

## FLEECE:
Oh,
these carolers are probably drunk as well.

---

template: noise
gasps

---

## WITSLOW:
Then I may need to deploy my trencher.

---

## FLEECE:
You’re a good man, constable

---

## WITSLOW:
Thank you, sir.

---

## FLEECE:
And gullible as a ripe cheese.

---

## &nbsp;
Now, get off me.

---

## WITSLOW:
Just one more thing.

---

## FLEECE:
Yes?

---

## WITSLOW:
I couldn’t help but notice
there’s a man on your back.

---


## FLEECE:
Yes.

---

## WITSLOW:
Who might that be?

---

## FLEECE:
My brother.

---

## WITSLOW:
Your brother?

---



## &nbsp;
Oh, yes, I see the resemblance.

---



## &nbsp;
Pardon the obvious question,

---

## &nbsp;
but why is he on your back
in the first place?

---

## GNAT:
I got a bad leg.

---

## WITSLOW:
A bad leg?

---

## FLEECE:
Right.

---

## WITSLOW:
Well, that’s very charitable of you, sir.

---

## FLEECE:
I promised our mother I would.

---

## WITSLOW:
I can only imagine it would get tiring.

---

## FLEECE:
Well, ordinarily.

---

## GNAT:
Yes, but I’m not heavy, I’m his brother.

---



---

## WITSLOW:
Nicely put, sir.

---

## &nbsp;
Nicely put.

---

## &nbsp;
Well, careful walking the icy streets
or you might not have a leg to stand on.

---

template: noise

---

## FLEECE:
Oh, ha-ha.

---



---

## WITSLOW:
Well, I better go see about them carolers.

---

## FLEECE:
Thank the devil he’s gone at last.

---

## &nbsp;
Now, get off me before my back gives out.

---

## &nbsp;
Despite your touching declaration,

---

## &nbsp;
you’re not my brother,
and you weigh a ton.

---

## GNAT:
Ow.

---

## &nbsp;
How are going to get inside?

---

## FLEECE:
With one of these.

---
## GNAT:
You’ve got a key?

---

## FLEECE:
As Chief Warder of Queen’s Prison,
I happen to be on intimate terms

---

## &nbsp;
with London’s third best locksmith,
who with minimal coaxing

---

## LOCKSMITH:
You want me to do what?

---

## FLEECE:
And a little encouragement

---

## LOCKSMITH:
My profession has ethical standards.

---

## FLEECE:
Plus a substantial bribe

---

## LOCKSMITH:
How’s next Thursday, son?

---

## FLEECE:
Provided me
with these seven skeleton keys.

---

## GNAT:
Skeleton?

---

## FLEECE:
One of which is guaranteed
to open this lock.

---

## GNAT:
I’ve got a thing about skeletons.

---

## FLEECE:
Oh, too bad,
there’s one hiding inside you.

---

template: noise

---


## &nbsp;
Now whether he has a backbone
remains to be seen.

---

## &nbsp;
Let’s try the first one, shall we?

---

## ONE:
Meanwhile in Henley-on-Thames.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
My family all told me,
Mr. Prattle, God rest his soul,

---

## &nbsp;
was a man without equal, elegant,
erudite, dapper, but without ostentation.

---

## &nbsp;
You’ll never find his like again.

---

## &nbsp;
Won’t they be surprised?

---

## MR. GARBLETON:
Yes, won’t they?

---

## ONE:
In st. James Palace

---

## STYFFLIP:
Your hat, My Lady.

---

## LADY PLUME:
Thank you, Stiffly.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Well, let’s lace the cake then.

---

## &nbsp;
Put it on.

---

## LADY PLUME:
Oh, dear.

---

## MR. GARBLETON:
Oh, my.

---

## LADY PLUME:
This can’t

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
What is it?

---

## STYFFLIP:
What is it?

---

## MR. GARBLETON:
This can’t.

---

## LADY PLUME:
Oh, my.

---

## MR. GARBLETON:
Oh, dear.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
Well, let me see it.

---

## STYFFLIP:
Let me see it.

---

template: noise

---


## MRS. PRATTLE:
Oh, dear.

---

## STYFFLIP:
Oh, my.

---

## ONE:
Outside the shop.

---
## &nbsp;
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.

---

## GNAT:
Not that one.

---

## ONE:
Six keys later.

---

## GNAT:
Not that one neither.

---

## FLEECE:
Are we inside?

---

## GNAT:
If we were, I think I could feel me toes.

---

## FLEECE:
Then no.

---

## &nbsp;
It wasn’t. It didn’t work.

---

## GNAT:
Are you sure this locksmith
knows his business?

---

## FLEECE:
I told you, he’s the third-best in London.

---

## GNAT:
Maybe I should’ve gone with the best.

---

## FLEECE:
Oh, thanks, Gnat.

---

## &nbsp;
If stealing priceless hats were easy,
everyone would do it.

---

template: noise
sighs

---

## &nbsp;
Did you hear the click?

---

## GNAT:
What click?

---

## FLEECE:
The click.

---

## &nbsp;
That means the difference between having

---

## &nbsp;
to bamboozle bobbies
and having our dreams come true.

---

## &nbsp;
Après toi mon ami.

---

## GNAT:
Once we cross the threshold,
we’re breaking the law.

---

## FLEECE:
Don’t tell me you’ve got cold feet.

---

## GNAT:
I’m cold all over.

---

## &nbsp;
Got to be 10 degrees out here.

---

## FLEECE:
Then,
why don’t you step inside and warm up?

You don’t suppose
they called off the wedding?

## GNAT:
Eerie in here.

---

## &nbsp;
All these hats with no heads in them

---

## &nbsp;
like a room full of ghosts.

---

## FLEECE:
You’ve been reading too much Poe.

---

## &nbsp;
Next, you’ll be hearing ravens.

---

## KIT:
It’s Mr. Fleece, from the prison.

---

## NED:
What would he be doing here at this hour?

---

## FLEECE:
There it is, Gnat.

---

## &nbsp;
Most of our futures, just out of reach.

---

## GNAT:
How are we going to get it down?

---

## FLEECE:
There’s got to be a transom
pole around here, somewhere.

---

## &nbsp;
Help me look.

---

## KIT/NED:
Mr. Dicken’s hat.

---

## GNAT:
I told you we should’ve brought a lantern.

---

## FLEECE:
We can’t afford to be seen inside,
not with that pesky Bobby about.

---

## KIT:
I am going up there.

---

## NED:
No, Kit.

---

## GNAT:
I think we should go.

---

## FLEECE:
Oh, just. Where is your spine?

---

## &nbsp;
Just find that pole,
and we can get out of here.

---

## VICTORIA:
Get out of here.

---

## FLEECE:
That’s what I said.

---

## GNAT:
What?

---

## FLEECE:
Find us a transom pole.

---

## GNAT:
I thought I heard something else.

---

## FLEECE:
There ought to be one beneath the windows.

---

## VICTORIA:
Stop talking.

---

## FLEECE:
What did you say to me?

---

## GNAT:
I didn’t say anything.

---

template: noise

## FLEECE:
Who’s there?

## &nbsp;
Show yourself.

## VICTORIA:
Get out of here.

---

## FLEECE:
What?

## &nbsp;
Of course,
we’ll be happy to leave, at once,

---

## &nbsp;
but we’d like to meet
you first so that we could

---

## VICTORIA:
Feed Victoria.

---

## FLEECE:
Excuse me?

---

## GNAT:
I think she said

---

## VICTORIA:
Please stop talking.

---

## GNAT:
Right.

---

## FLEECE:
Hang on.

---

## VICTORIA:
Get out of here.

---

## FLEECE:
Our anonymous friend
has an intriguingly limited vocabulary.

---

## VICTORIA:
Feed Victoria.

---

## FLEECE:
One might almost call it parrot-like.

---

## GNAT:
Well, I’ll be

---

## FLEECE:
You may not be the best watchdog,
but I’ve met worse conversationalists.

---

## VICTORIA:
Stop talking.

---

## FLEECE:
Oh, shut up.

---

## &nbsp;
Come on, let’s find that pole,
so we can get out

---

## WITSLOW:
As a baby in me pram 

---

## FLEECE:
Oh, God.

---

## WITSLOW:
Gazing up upon me mam,

---

## &nbsp;
I was rosy cheeked and smiling ear to ear.

---

## FLEECE:
Mannequin.

---

## WITSLOW:
For she looked upon her boy

---

## &nbsp;
with a sweet maternal joy

---

## &nbsp;
and I knew that I had
nothing in this world to fear.

---

## &nbsp;
Oh,
if I had only known that one day I’d be

---

## &nbsp;
alone and my mam would be up high in heaven.

---

## FLEECE:
Forget the pole.

---

## &nbsp;
Let me climb on your back.

---

## GNAT:
I’ve got a bad leg.

---

## FLEECE:
Don’t start that again.

---

## &nbsp;
I’ll just be up there for a moment
so I could - It’s gone!

---

## GNAT:
What?

---

## FLEECE:
The hat.

---

## &nbsp;
It’s not there anymore.

---

## GNAT:
Well, that’s not possible.

---

## FLEECE:
Possible or not, it’s true.

---

## GNAT:
You don’t suppose the parrot.

---

## FLEECE:
No, not the parrot, Gnat.

---

## &nbsp;
I think there may be another human
in this shop.

---

## KIT:
I had been reading
to Peggotty about crocodiles.

---

## &nbsp;
I must have read very perspicuously,

---

## &nbsp;
or the poor soul must
have been deeply interested

---

## &nbsp;
for they had
a cloudy expression about them

---

## &nbsp;
as I had learned
that they were a sort of vegetable.

---

## FLEECE:
Well, isn’t this a cozy sight.

---

## &nbsp;
Look, Gnat, it’s storytime.

---

## KIT:
Mr. Fleece, what brings you here?

---

## FLEECE:
Oh,
the same thought popped into my mind, Kit.

---

## &nbsp;
Why aren’t you back in cell 34?

---

## GNAT:
That’s what I asked when she was leaving.

---

## NED:
You shouldn’t be in the shop at night.

---

## &nbsp;
My father

---

## FLEECE:
It’s in Henley-on-Thames
whereby all rights you should be.

---

## &nbsp;
Was that David Copperfield
you were reading?

---

## KIT:
How would you know?

---

## FLEECE:
Oh, I know all of Dickens’ works.

---

## &nbsp;
My, what a voluminous volume.

---

## &nbsp;
One could kill a rat with that.

---

## NED:
You’re lucky if I don’t throw it at you.

---

## FLEECE:
That doesn’t sound
like a Garbleton welcome.

---

## KIT:
I know why you’ve come.

---

## FLEECE:
Search those boxes.

---

## KIT:
It’s not here.

---

## &nbsp;
Mr. Garbleton sold it.

---

template: noise

---

## FLEECE:
Don’t lie to me, girl.

---

## &nbsp;
He’d never sell that one,
too much of a sentimentalist.

---

## NED:
Why do you want it?

---

## FLEECE:
To sell it, of course.

---

## &nbsp;
I’m not a sentimentalist.

---

## GNAT:
Oh, all of them’s empty.

---

## KIT:
There, what did I tell you.

---

## FLEECE:
Stand up.

---

## KIT:
Why?

---

## FLEECE:
Because I said so.

---

## KIT:
I work for Mr. Garbleton, not you.

---

template: noise

---

## FLEECE:
I said stand up.

---

## NED:
Don’t touch her.

---

## FLEECE:
Search those boxes again.

---

## GNAT:
I already did.

---

## &nbsp;
There’s nothing there.

---

## FLEECE:
Oh, out of my way.

---

## &nbsp;
I’ll do it myself.

---

## &nbsp;
One should never judge
a hat box by its lid, Nat.

---

## GNAT:
I don’t even know what that means.

---

## FLEECE:
It means…ah. 
---
## GNAT:
“Ah”?
---

## FLEECE:
“A cover conceals more than it reveals…”

---

template: noise

---

## GNAT:
What?

---

## &nbsp;
It’s all smashed.

---

## FLEECE:
It’s an opera hat, Gnat.

---

## &nbsp;
Oh, there, look,
there’s his name on the headband,

---

## &nbsp;
Mr. Charles Dickens Esquire.

---

## KIT:
That hat doesn’t belong to you.

---

## FLEECE:
I won’t have it for long.

---

## KIT:
It belongs to everyone.

---

## FLEECE:
No, the stories belong to everyone.

---

## &nbsp;
This will go to a special someone
who will pay me handsomely for it.

---

## &nbsp;
Well, look at that.

---

## &nbsp;
Only 7 and 1/8.

---

## &nbsp;
Such an average head.

---

## &nbsp;
One would of thought
it would have to be huge

---

## &nbsp;
to hold so many people in it.

---

## &nbsp;
Ms. Havisham, Wilkins Micawber,

---

## &nbsp;
Fagin, Smike, Ebenezer Scrooge.

---

## &nbsp;
Now there’s a magician’s hat for sure.

---

## NED:
How do you know all those characters?

---

## FLEECE:
A boy shut away in a prison
must have some means of escape.

---

## KIT:
This special someone,
do they love Mr. Dickens too?

---

## FLEECE:
Enough to get me out
of that prison for good.

---

## &nbsp;
Put it in a box for me.

---

## NED:
Boxes are only for paying customers.

---

## FLEECE:
Which is what I want to look
like if any constables get in my way.

---

## &nbsp;
Do it.

---

## KIT:
If you leave the prison,
what about my father?

---

## FLEECE:
Gnat will take over the debtors’
repayment program.

---

## GNAT:
With all the

---

## FLEECE:
With all the what, yes?

---

## GNAT:
Percocet’s of the position.

---

## THREE:
Percocet, which won’t be
invented for another 100 years.

---



---

## FLEECE:
It means that he can skim
off whatever he likes

---

## &nbsp;
and whenever he likes
and as long as he likes

---

## &nbsp;
and there’s nothing you can do about it.

---

## KIT:
My father is due
to be let out in 11 weeks.

---

## FLEECE:
Well, we’ll see.

---

## &nbsp;
That all depends on how quiet
a girl can be about a certain hat.

---

## &nbsp;
Thank you.

---

## &nbsp;
Now, get back to Queen’s
Prison where you belong.

---

## KIT:
I can’t get back in.

---

## &nbsp;
It’s locked for the night.

---

## FLEECE:
Well then you’ll have to sleep
on the doorstep until it opens again.

---

## &nbsp;
Here’s your blanket, you may need it.

---

## NED:
Don’t forget your feather box, Kit.

---

## &nbsp;
Your father may want to see
the Norwegian peacock.

---

## KIT:
A Norwegian I think you’re right, Ned.

---

## &nbsp;
I’ll see you tomorrow.

---

## GNAT:
What should we do about the boy?

---

## FLEECE:
Oh, lock him in the basement
so he can’t go yelling for constables.

---

## &nbsp;
One of these ought to work.

---

## &nbsp;
Let’s see. How about a Norwegian peacock.

---

## GNAT:
What?

---

## FLEECE:
Peacocks don’t live in Norway.

---

## &nbsp;
No.

## &nbsp;
Damn and blasted.

TONIGHT.

---

## TWO:
Her frozen feet lead
her to the Hungerford Bridge

---

## &nbsp;
as if crossing the river might save her,
lead her back to her father,

---

## &nbsp;
though she knows he’s trapped
with an iron and stone.

---

## THREE:
She starts across anyway,
stumbling and slipping

---

## &nbsp;
on the icy rails until nearly
halfway across, she hears

---

## FLEECE:
You can’t run forever,
not in those filthy rags you call shoes.

---

## &nbsp;
Even if you could, I’d catch her.

---

## &nbsp;
You might as well stop and hand it over.

---

## &nbsp;
Then we both can go back to our evenings.

---

## KIT:
Mr. Dickens used this hat
to comfort people who were dying,

---

## &nbsp;
no matter if they were rich or poor.

---

## FLEECE:
Then he’s as naive as your employer.

---

## &nbsp;
Beneath our hats, we are all the same.

---

## &nbsp;
If that were true,
why are some dining in Queen’s

---

## &nbsp;
Palace while others
are pining in Queen’s Prison.

---

## &nbsp;
We have to take
what we want in this world,

---

## &nbsp;
for the world will never
give it up freely.

---

## KIT:
You’re wrong.

---

## FLEECE:
Then prove it.

---

## &nbsp;
Give it up freely.

---

## KIT:
Never.

---

## FLEECE:
All right then, I’ll take it.

---

## FIVE:
He starts after her and she turns
to run but is stopped by a chilling sound.

---

## FOUR:
She never had to memorize
the railway timetables

---

## &nbsp;
this late at night
and now she wishes she had.

---

## FLEECE:
Oh, look, a train,
and that’s on a train track.

---

## TWO:
She wonders
whether she might make it across in time

---

## &nbsp;
before the train reaches the bridge
separating her and her pursuers.

---

## THREE:
She decides to try.

---

## FOUR
Before she could take a single step

---

## FIVE:
The light hits her face.

---

## TWO:
The trains up the narrow bridge.

---

## FLEECE:
Come on,
if you hurry you can make it in time.

---

## THREE:
Now the rest of her is frozen as well.

---

## FLEECE:
Well, don’t just stand there, run.

---

## FIVE:
Fleece rushes toward her.

---

## OLD ENGINEER:
High up in a hot locomotive,

---

## &nbsp;
an old engineer peers out
through snow and sleet and sees

---

## &nbsp;
could it be a girl standing in the middle
of the track and a man running toward her?

---

## TWO:
No time for brakes,
not at this speed, not on this ice.

---

## &nbsp;
Instead, he blows his whistle and prays.

---

## THREE:
The blast jolts Kit and just
in time she clambers

---

## &nbsp;
onto the outside of the iron bridge,
clinging to its latticework.

---

## FIVE:
The train hurdles
by toward the man in pursuit.

---

## THREE:
With no time to spare, he too leaps
onto the crisscross girders out of danger.

---

## OLD ENGINEER:
The engineer opens one eye,
then two, then crosses himself.

---

## FIVE:
Leaving a girl and a one-eyed
man clinging to the side

---

## &nbsp;
of Hungerford Bridge as car
after car of coal rolls by.

---

template: noise
background noise

---

## FLEECE:
Well, now, you almost got us both killed.

---

## &nbsp;
Come on, no more games.

---

## &nbsp;
Hand it over.

---

## KIT:
No.

---

## FLEECE:
I’ll take it one way or the other.

---

## KIT:
Not if I throw it into the river.

---

## FLEECE:
Oh, you’d never do that.

---

## KIT:
I might.

---

## FLEECE:
You just went across half the city
to save it, why destroy it now?

---

## KIT:
To stop you from getting it.

---

## FLEECE:
Well, now my feelings are hurt.

---

## &nbsp;
Come on, enough of this.

---

## &nbsp;
Don’t be silly.

---

## &nbsp;
Give it to me now.

---

 ## KIT:
I am not going to give it to you.

---

## FLEECE:
All right then. How about a trade?

---

## KIT:
A trade?

---

## FLEECE:
Yes.

---

## &nbsp;
You give me the hat

---

## &nbsp;
in exchange for my little red book.

---

## THREE:
By now, the train has crossed the river,

---

## &nbsp;
clattering on into the city to feed
its hungry factories and furnaces.

---

## KIT:
Why would I want that?

---

## FLEECE:
You know why, because it’s the only way

---

## &nbsp;
you’ll prove you already
paid off your father’s debts.

---

## KIT:
Already paid?

---

## FLEECE:
Without this record,
the last two years would all be for naught

---

## &nbsp;
and your father will go
on wasting away in Queen’s Prison.

---

## KIT:
If you give that to me,
you’ll be exposed as a thief.

---

## FLEECE:
I’ll disappear,
and Mordecai Fleece will be no more.

---

## FIVE:
The two figures are still,
the iron-work numbing their naked hands.

---

## &nbsp;
The only sound is the sweep
of wind and the waters far below.

---

## FLEECE:
Well, Kit, what’s more important;

---

## &nbsp;
a hat or your father’s freedom?

---

## &nbsp;
I’m willing to wait, but you’re the one
not dressed for the weather.

---

## &nbsp;
You’ll give me the book
then I’ll give you the hat.

---

## KIT:
No.

---

## FLEECE:
You give me the hat
and I’ll give you the book.

---

## KIT:
First, the book then the hat.

---

## FLEECE:
First, the hat then the book.

---

## KIT:
Book first.

---

## FLEECE:
Hat first.

---

## KIT:
Book.

---

## FLEECE:
Hat.

---

## KIT:
Book.

---

## FLEECE:
Hat.

---

## KIT/FLEECE:
Same time.

---

template: noise
grunting

---

## FLEECE:
On the count of three, one

---

## KIT:
Two.

---

## &nbsp;
Hey!

---

## FLEECE:
Thank you.

---

## KIT:
That’s not fair.

---

## FLEECE:
I’m the villain.

---

## &nbsp;
What did you expect?

---

## KIT:
You’re despicable.

---

## FLEECE:
Oh, look on the bright side.

---

## KIT:
What bright side?

---

## FLEECE:
You’re right. There isn’t any.

---

## &nbsp;
Au revoir, or should I say adieu?

---

template: noise
screams

---

## FOUR:
At that moment,
there on the side of Hungerford Bridge,

---

## &nbsp;
the sole of his shoe slips in the snow,

---

## &nbsp;
and a man with two hats and one
eye falls down, down into the darkness,

---

## &nbsp;
down through the swirling flakes,
out of sight,

---

## &nbsp;
toward the tar-black river below until,
at last, wait for it.

---

## CHORUS:
Sploosh.

---

template: noise
bell rings

---

## FOUR:
The only sounds remaining
are wind and chattering teeth.

---

## CAROLERS:
Calm.

---

## &nbsp;
Calm.

---

## &nbsp;
NIGHT IS CALM.

---

## &nbsp;
DARKNESS COMFORTS LIKE A PSALM

---

## &nbsp;
SO GIVE THANKS NOW PALM TO PALM.

---

## &nbsp;
THE NIGHT IS CALM.

---

## &nbsp;
THE NIGHT IS STILL. STILL.

---

## &nbsp;
NIGHT IS STILL.

---

## &nbsp;
MAY YOUR DOOR KEEP OUT THE CHILL.

---

## &nbsp;
MAY TOMORROW BRING GOODWILL.

---

## &nbsp;
THE NIGHT IS STILL.

---

## &nbsp;
THE NIGHT IS STILL.

---

## TWO:
Fleece survived his plunge
into the Thames, and was dragged

---

## &nbsp;
insensible from it by a mackerel
fisherman named Jiles Pigot.

---

## PIGGOT:
This the biggest fish I ever caught.

---

template: noise
crowd laughs

---

## FOUR:
When he regained consciousness,

---

## &nbsp;
Fleece discovered he was
warm and dry and under arrest,

---

## &nbsp;
thanks to Constable Witslow.

---

## WITSLOW:
Inspector Witslow, if you please.

---

## ONE:
Inside of Fleece’s pocket
was found a little red notebook.

---

## &nbsp;
It’s pages damp but legible,
documenting every last

---

## &nbsp;
shilling taken from the so-called
debtor’s repayment program.

---

## TWO:
Money was found in a traveling
case beneath his bed and applied

---

## &nbsp;
to the debts of the incarcerated
as he had claimed to do all along.

---
## THREE:
He returned to Queen’s Prison,
though no longer master of the keys,

---

## &nbsp;
to resume his life within iron and stone.

---

## FLEECE:
Oh, crap.

---

template: noise
crowd laughs

---

## FIVE:
Kit, however, in the spirit of the season,

---

## &nbsp;
brought him her collection
of penny dreadfuls.

---

template: noise
crowd laughs

---

## KIT:
A man shut away in a prison
deserves some means of escape.

---

## FOUR:
True to his name,
Gnat was declared by her majesty’s court

---

## &nbsp;
to be “irritating but non-threatening”

---

template: noise
crowd laughs

---

## &nbsp;
and given a suspended sentence.

---

## FIVE:
Though this won’t prevent
it for several decades.

---

## TWO:
Kit’s father was released for good.

---

## KIT:
Father.

---

## FATHER:
Kit.

---

template: noise
laughs

---

## THREE:
Mr. Dickens’ hat floated all the way

---

## &nbsp;
to Gravesend before being plucked out,

---

## &nbsp;
hardly the worse for wear,
by a small girl called Polly Preacher.

---

## POLLY:
I said to my mum, “Can I keep it?”

---

## MUM:
Mum said, “Who do you think you are?

---

## &nbsp;
The Duchess of Cornwall?”

---

template: noise
crowd laughs

---

## POLLY:
which means no.

---

## FIVE:
Thanks to the Garbleton label inside,

---

## &nbsp;
it was restored to its place
of honor where it still resides.

---

## KIT:
To celebrate their good fortune,

---

## &nbsp;
Mr. Garbleton and Mrs. Prattle,
the Garbleton-Prattles,

---

## &nbsp;
held a dinner inviting Kit and her father

---

## &nbsp;
and even Lady Plume who kindly accepted

---

## &nbsp;
along with her Blenheim Spaniel, Montague.

---

template: noise

---

## LADY PLUME:
She wore her levee hat
to the table having single-handedly

---

## &nbsp;
launched a new popular
trend in ladies’ headwear.

---

template: noise

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
I’m so glad it all worked out, milady.

---

---

## &nbsp;
Ned, would you please pass the potatoes?

---

## &nbsp;
There’s a dear.

---

## NED:
Yes, mother.

---

## VICTORIA:
Feed Victoria.

---

## LADY PLUME:
I owe it all to you, Mrs. Prattle.

---

## &nbsp;
Who would have thought that a woman
of my age would become a model of fashion?

---


## &nbsp;
My fondest wish
at the moment would be to bring

---

## &nbsp;
back an item left behind by haute
couture in the last century.

---

## MRS. PRATTLE:
What might that be?

---

## LADY PLUME:
Shoe buckles.

---

## MR. GARBLETON:
Shoe buckles?

---

## LADY PLUME:
But, alas, no one makes them anymore.

---

## KIT:
Actually, I know someone who does.

---

## TWO:
This brings our story to a close.

---

## THREE:
So we can return you to the present.

---

## FOUR:
November 28, 2021.

---

## FIVE:
And all the different hats you wear.

---

## ONE:
May they fit you well.

---

## ALL:
And keep you warm
through all your days and nights to come.
