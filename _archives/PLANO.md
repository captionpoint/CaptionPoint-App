## ANNE:
Oh, thanks.

Yeah, what the fuck—you’re glowing.

## ANNE:
Okay, cool, so the thing I wanted to tell you is that
I’m pregnant, and so, wow.
--

## GENEVIEVE:
Okay.
---
## ISABEL:
I knew this, I knew this.
---
## ANNE:
You knew this?
--

## ISABEL:
I knew this—how did I know this?—I just knew.
---
## ANNE:
Well, you were right.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Who did this?
--

## ANNE:
His name is John.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
John—okay, is he from the college?
--

## ANNE:
No, he’s from the neighborhood.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
From the neighborhood?
--

## ANNE:
Yes, yeah.
---
## ISABEL:
Neat.
--

## GENEVIEVE:
How’d you meet?
---
## ANNE:
I met him at Bolsa Mercado.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Oh, okay, what does he do?
---
## ISABEL:
What’s Bolsa Mercado?
--

## ANNE:
The new market, it’s great.
---
## ISABEL:
Is it great?
--

## GENEVIEVE:
It’s great.
---
## ISABEL:
Let’s go.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
What does he do?
---
## ANNE:
He works at Bolsa Mercado.
--

## GENEVIEVE:
He works at Bolsa Mercado?
---
## ANNE:
He works there, he works in the back.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Oh, okay so you’re saying he works in the back.
---
## ANNE:
I met him in the parking lot, he was loading things into the back.
---
## ISABEL:
Manly!
Fun!
I’m happy for you.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
I don’t get it, you had sex—you had sex with a manual laborer?
---
## ANNE:
What is wrong with that?
--

## ISABEL:
Yeah, what’s wrong with that?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Nothing.
--

## ANNE:
Okay, you think it’s wrong.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Not at all, it’s sexy.
--

## ISABEL:
It’s so sexy.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
It’s just surprising.
--

## ANNE:
Why is it surprising?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
You’re the kind of person who falls in love with other professors.
---
## ANNE:
Well, I fell in love with John and he works in the back.
--

## ISABEL:
I want to meet him.
---
## ANNE:
Okay, I’ll introduce him later.
It’s later, here he is.
This is John.
---
## JOHN:
Hi, I’m Juan.
--

## ISABEL:
Y’all what?
---
## ANNE:
What?
--

## ISABEL:
You said his name different.
--

## JOHN:
Sorry, oops.
---
## ANNE:
Sorry, oh, yeah, he likes being called "John".
--

## ISABEL:
But it’s "Juan".
---
## JOHN:
I don’t mind.
--

## ANNE:
He doesn’t mind.
---
## JOHN:
I prefer it.
--

## ANNE:
He insisted.
---
## JOHN:
I’ve always wanted to be "John".
---
## ANNE:
He’s always wanted to be John and I’ve always
wanted a John, and then I found Juan.
---
## JOHN:
I’ll be your John.
--

## ANNE:
You are my John.
---
## JOHN:
Thank you.
--

## ISABEL:
Got it.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
How’s it going, y’all, I mean the pregnancy?
---
## ANNE:
It’s great.
--

## JOHN:
It’s great, you’re both so beautiful.
---
## ISABEL:
Oh, thanks.
--

## GENEVIEVE:
Anne is beautiful.
---
## JOHN:
Yes, I hear you, all beautiful, beautiful sisters.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
How’s the pregnancy Anne, really?
---
## ANNE:
It’s fine, it’s awful, it’s in me, why do we do it?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
I’ve had three kids.
--

## ISABEL:
It’s not a competition.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
I support myself through sculpting.
---
## JOHN:
I have to go.
--

## ANNE:
Oh, okay.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Where are you going?
--

## JOHN:
Plano.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Okay, bye, where did he go?
---
## ANNE:
He goes to Plano, he has friends in Plano.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Who goes to Plano?
--

## ANNE:
He does, it’s where he goes.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Plano is where all the big-haired boob ladies
live.
--

## ANNE:
Okay.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Plano is like Dallas’ synthetic ghost.
--

## ANNE:
Sure.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Plano is so *white*.
--

## ANNE:
And yet he enjoys Plano.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Stop saying Plano, I hate Plano, who hangs out in Plano?
--

## ANNE:
He does.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Fine, I’ll consider it a red flag.
---
## ISABEL:
Where in Mexico is he from?
---
## ANNE:
Juarez, also I have something to tell you.
--

## GENEVIEVE:
What?
---
## ANNE:
John got fired from Bolsa Mercado.
--

## ISABEL:
Oh, why?
---
## ANNE:
He’s too honest or something, he didn’t want to tell me, also I have something to tell you.
--

## GENEVIEVE:
What?
---
## ANNE:
John and I are getting married.
--

## ISABEL:
WHOA.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
When?
--

## ISABEL:
I’m so excited.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
When?
--

## ISABEL:
Mom’s gonna be so relieved.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
When, Anne?
---
## ANNE:
Oh, we actually already got married, in the court.
---
## ISABEL:
Oh, man.
--

## GENEVIEVE:
Oh, Anne.
---
## ANNE:
Oh, what?
--

## GENEVIEVE:
Are you okay?
---
## ANNE:
I’m great.
---
## ISABEL:
Your wedding was going to be so beautiful, I wanted to help you do your wedding.
---
## ANNE:
You can help me do the wedding later.
---
## ANNE:
It’s later, and let’s just not do the wedding, I’m too pregnant, I’m too busy, it’s fine.
---
## ISABEL:
Do you want to hear my news?
--

## ANNE:
What?
---
## ISABEL:
I’m moving to Chicago to help poor pregnant people.
---
## ANNE:
Oh, God, what, like on the streets?
--

## ISABEL:
No, in buildings.
---
## ANNE:
Oh, God, what, like in tenements?
---
## ISABEL:
What, no, for a Catholic non-profit.
---
## ANNE:
Oh, God, well, are you healthy finally?
---
## ISABEL:
Yeah, I’m healthy and ready to have a life!
---
## ANNE:
Oh, God, well, so, you’re not gonna finish your degree?
---
## ISABEL:
No, I can’t, I just can’t, I’m going crazy, I need to help people right away.
---
## ANNE:
Oh, God, but do Mom and Dad know you’re quitting school?
---
## ISABEL:
Yes and they’re mad but I don’t care because I know what God wants for me and it feels freaking great.
---
## ANNE:
Oh, God, I’m gonna miss you.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
You’ll be great, Isabel.
--

## ISABEL:
Thanks.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Just don’t become a nun.
--

## ISABEL:
I won’t, thanks.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
You’re too hot.
--

## ISABEL:
Okay, thanks, bye.
---
## ANNE:
Bye.
--

## GENEVIEVE:
Bye.
--

## ISABEL:
Bye.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Steve, come say “bye”!
---
## STEVE:
To who?
--

## GENEVIEVE:
To Isabel.
---
## STEVE:
Bye, Isabel.
--

## ISABEL:
Bye Steve—oh, where’s John?
---
## ANNE:
He’s out, he’s in Plano, oh, and I wanted to tell you,
---
## ANNE:
Steve and Genevieve, that I’m going to ask you to be the godfathers of my baby.
---
## STEVE:
Awesome, so awesome, a little dude.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Great, we’ll try not to make him hate Catholicism like we do.
---
## ISABEL:
What’s wrong with Catholicism?
---
## ANNE:
Isabel, you’ll be godfather to the next baby.
---
## ISABEL:
God*mother*.
--

## ANNE:
What did I say?
---
## ISABEL:
Okay, before I move to Chicago, I want to tell you, Anne,
---
## ISABEL:
that I’ve had this scary thought which is maybe that John is using you for his green card,
---
## ISABEL:
and that he doesn’t actually love you.
---
## ANNE:
What?
---
## STEVE:
And maybe he’s gay.
--

## ANNE:
What?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
He told Steve some weird things, and we started to wonder if he was gay.
---
## ANNE:
No, who cares?
---
## STEVE:
He just said some weird things.
--

## ANNE:
Who cares, what’d he say?
---
## STEVE:
He said that I’m handsome and that he’s in love with a man at his work.
---
## ISABEL:
Oh, wow.
--

## ANNE:
Who cares?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Anne, don’t fuck up your life.
--

## ANNE:
What?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Don’t fuck up your life.
---
## STEVE:
Genevieve, oh, my gosh be less harsh.
--

## GENEVIEVE:
Shut up, Steve.
---
## ANNE:
Can we talk about this later?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Sure.
---
## ANNE:
It’s later.
Merry Christmas, Isabel, how’s Chicago?
---
## ISABEL:
Merry Christmas, it’s great, it’s cold, I love my job, it’s impossible,
---
## ISABEL:
there are so many people and they’re all in pain,
---
## ISABEL:
I haven’t slept in three days, I felt
something fall out of me,
---
## ISABEL:
I don’t trust my own brain, I’m going to therapy.
---
## ANNE:
That’s so great.
---
## ISABEL:
Oh, my gosh, you had your baby and he’s sleeping in the other room.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
His name is Javier Greg.
---
## STEVE:
He’s cute isn’t he, huh, but also our kids are cuter right, Genevieve?
—haha just kidding.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
But, yes, they technically are.
--

## ISABEL:
Rude.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Whatever, our kids are like K is for Kids, and Javier Greg looks like a dying worm.
---
## ISABEL:
No, he’s precious.
---
## ANNE:
Yeah, well it’s crazy, I had him.
---
## ISABEL:
And how’s John, Anne?
--

## ANNE:
He’s fine.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Ugh.
--

## ANNE:
What?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Nothing.
--

## ISABEL:
What?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
He’s good with the baby, that’s what matters.
---
## STEVE:
But he’s never around, and he’s definitely gay.
--

## ANNE:
Y’all stop.
---
## ISABEL:
Oh, no, though.
--

## ANNE:
Who cares?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
You should care, it’s your life.
---
## ANNE:
We have a thing, a little life, it’s fine.
---
## ISABEL:
Oh, it makes me sad.
--

## ANNE:
Who cares?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
I don’t know how you do it.
---
## ANNE:
I don’t want to talk about it, it’s Christmas.
--

## STEVE:
Yeah.
---
## JOHN:
Merry Christmas, everyone.
---
## ANNE:
You’re so sweet, John, maybe you should stick around awhile
---
## ANNE:
and tell everyone some things about yourself,
---
## ANNE:
If you want.
I love you.
---
## JOHN:
I love you, too.
Okay, Merry Christmas, everyone, Feliz Navidad,
---
## JOHN:
what are we eating, can I help cook, that was delicious, let me help clean,
---
## JOHN:
I love this porch, ah I feel tipsy, okay things about myself,
---
## JOHN:
let’s start with what a beautiful year it’s been, the best year of my life,
---
## JOHN:
even with all the thorns, I’m so happy to know you all,
---
## JOHN:
I’m so happy to know Anne, and to know my baby son,
---
## JOHN:
sometimes I sit with him and sing him songs,
---
## JOHN:
sometimes I tell him stories about how we ended up in this room together,
---
## JOHN:
how beautiful it’s all been, how much hope I have,
---
## JOHN:
I always knew, I always knew that somehow everything would be okay,
---
## JOHN:
when I sent my mother a Christmas card this month it had more money in it than it’s ever had before
---
## JOHN:
and she called me weeping asking if it was hers and I said Mama of course of course this is yours,
---
## JOHN:
I love you so much and miss you every day, actually, oops,
---
## JOHN:
I think I might have dreamt that phone call, I need to call my mother,
---
## JOHN:
I can’t believe how sad it all is, but how beautiful, too, I get overwhelmed,
---
## JOHN:
I spend too much money on shoes, do you like my shoes,
---
## JOHN:
shoes doesn’t really help, what really helps is hope and grace,
---
## JOHN:
and if you just breathe through your nose for six seconds, in and out in and out, it starts to feel a little better,
---
## JOHN:
and I worry that I’m not good to people, I worry that I’m cold,
---
## JOHN:
I worry that my love language is getting lost in translation,
---
## JOHN:
I worry that I’m being chased by the devil, and did I tell you about when I was a little boy in Juarez,
---
## JOHN:
when I was very young, and when I saw a little red ball playing the piano,
---
## JOHN:
bouncing on the piano, playing it,
---
## JOHN:
and I ran into my mother’s room and my mother suggested perhaps it was an angel who wanted to play with me
---
## JOHN:
and anyway that was a long time ago,
---
## JOHN:
I miss being a little boy, if I could right now I would ask the little boy who is me
---
## JOHN:
about the old battle between time and duration,
---
## JOHN:
and about the length of the hallway, a nightmare is a hallway you have to walk down,
---
## JOHN:
and being here with you right now feels like a hallway,
---
## JOHN:
but when I really get worried I remember that I have a cozy heart and a cozy future,
---
## JOHN:
and I’m going home to Anne, and Javier Greg,
---
## JOHN:
and sometimes I’ll see you Genevieve and you Steve and you Isabel,
---
## JOHN:
you’re all so beautiful, and I’m a lucky man, Merry Christmas,
---
## JOHN:
okay I gotta go, lovers.
---
## ANNE:
Where are you going, John?
--

## JOHN:
I’m going to Plano.
---
## ANNE:
Oh, wait come back!
I wanted us all to take a picture.
---
## ANNE:
Oh, well, we’re going down to Juarez for New Years.
---
## STEVE:
It’s dangerous down there.
--

## GENEVIEVE:
Don’t go.
---
## ISABEL:
Be careful.
--

## ANNE:
I will.
See you later.
---
## ANNE:
It’s later.
Juarez was wonderful.
--

## GENEVIEVE:
Really?
---
## ANNE:
Yes really.
--

## GENEVIEVE:
Really?
---
## ANNE:
Please stop othering my husband.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
I wasn’t.
--

## ANNE:
You were.
---
## ISABEL:
But Anne, it was nice?
---
## ANNE:
Yeah, yes it was, thank you, John’s mother held my hands and spoke to me in Spanish,
---
## ANNE:
I only understood some of it, but I started crying.
---
## ISABEL:
That’s beautiful.
---
## STEVE:
Javier, Greg is crying.
--

## ANNE:
I hear him.
---
## ISABEL:
I’ll go mother him, I’m motherly
---
## ANNE:
John will mother it.
*John, will you mother it*?
--

## JOHN:
Yes lover.
---
## ANNE:
He’s good with the baby, and many other things, and
he’s my husband.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
I could never be married to a man I never see.
--

## ANNE:
I see him.
---
## STEVE:
I am seen.
--

## ISABEL:
What do you two talk about?
---
## ANNE:
We talk, I talk things out, he talks things out, we’re
also comfortable with silence.
---
## STEVE:
Do you agree that he’s gay?
--

## ANNE:
Maybe so, maybe so.
---
## ISABEL:
Anne are you lonely?
--

## ANNE:
Yes, incredibly.
---
## ISABEL:
Did he do something nice for you for your birthday?
---
## ANNE:
What?
Yeah, he…
---
template: noise
silence
---
## ANNE:
Yeah.
--

## ISABEL:
That’s nice.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Do you really think you’re going to spend the rest of your life with him,
---
## GENEVIEVE:
and like how would that even work, you’re so different,
---
## GENEVIEVE:
and he’s using you, and he’s lying to you,
---
## GENEVIEVE:
and you’re so much smarter than he is, you’re a beautiful person,
---
## GENEVIEVE:
you deserve to be with someone who can stay up all night talking to you about books
---
## GENEVIEVE:
and who will come home and give you big raspberry kisses on your baby’s butt and then your butt,
---
## GENEVIEVE:
and even if I am othering him maybe I don’t care because what I’m talking about is this *particular* man using you,
---
## GENEVIEVE:
*this* man, thinking you’re a fool, thinking we’re all fools,
---
## GENEVIEVE:
this drives me crazy, I want to kill him.
---
## ANNE:
Do you mind if we stop talking about John?
---
## ISABEL:
Oh.
--

## GENEVIEVE:
Oh.
--

## STEVE:
Sure.
---
## ANNE:
Yeah, just do you mind, do you mind if we just stop talking about John?
---
## ISABEL:
Sure.
--

## GENEVIEVE:
Yeah.
---
## STEVE:
Yeah, sorry, and also, Genevieve, I have so many secrets,
---
## STEVE:
so many shameful little shameful little ah fuck ah fuck,
---
## STEVE:
there’s an intern, there’s an intern, and our marriage won’t last the year.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
What?
---
## STEVE:
Sorry, Isabel, do you still like me?
---
## ISABEL:
Of course, you’re Steve, our lovable brother-in-law.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
What did you say?
---
## STEVE:
Sorry, Isabel, do you think I’m good?
--

## ISABEL:
Of course you’re good.
---
## STEVE:
Sorry, Anne, you were saying?
---
## ANNE:
I was needing to talk about anything else, I want to talk about something beautiful, anything.
---
## ISABEL:
We’ll talk about anything.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
What do you want to talk about?
---
## ANNE:
I want to talk about this thing that happened to me,
---
## ANNE:
I was sitting down in Juarez and I felt something real wash into me, like real, like how I actually am,
---
## ANNE:
I suddenly saw myself, and I felt okay with it…
---
## ANNE:
I know that I’m sad, I’m really sad, yeah, I have been for a long time.

---
## ANNE:
I feel made up, and I feel like I had no hand in that making up.

---
## ANNE:
I don’t know why I’m suddenly a mother, and a wife.

---
## ANNE:
And I don’t know why I’m suddenly thirty-five.
---
## ANNE:
(quieter) I love and hate everyone, I scream in my car, I scream at my kid,
---
## ANNE:
I’m afraid of saying anything to John that will make him hate me, I want everything to be okay,

---
## ANNE:
I just want to help him, he’s good, he’s my um, sorry sorry,
---
## ANNE:
I want to tell you about this thing that happened to me.

---
## ANNE:
When I was in Juarez, I saw a woman sitting in front of her house.
---
## ANNE:
(even quieter) She was wearing a dark blue dress, she was drinking something out of a little wooden cup.
---
## ANNE:
And I was sitting watching her.
---
## ANNE:
(quieter and quieter)And then she saw me and she looked at me for a long time and then
she just started laughing.
---
## ANNE:
And I laughed, too.
---
## ANNE:
(barely audible) And, uh, I dunno, I dunno.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
What, speak up?
--

## ISABEL:
Anne, what?
---
## ANNE:
What?
--

## STEVE:
You’re talking really quietly.
---
## ANNE:
Who cares?
---
## ISABEL:
But what happened in the story, I want to know.
--

## ANNE:
An old woman laughed at me!
---
## ISABEL:
Okay!
Are you okay?
--

## ANNE:
Yes!

---
## ANNE:
I just don’t want to be sad all the time, and I don’t want you to feel bad for me all the fucking time,
---
## ANNE:
I really don’t, stop feeling bad for me, I’m fucking fine, I’m figuring it out, I’m fine,
---
## ANNE:
I just want to laugh about something.

---
## ANNE:
Genevieve, can you say something funny?

---
## ANNE:
Or Isabel, can you make up a funny song?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Sure.
--

## ISABEL:
Yeah.
---
## STEVE:
Or I can tell a joke.
--

## ANNE:
Great, yeah.
---
## STEVE:
Okay, let me try to remember it.

I love you.
What do you love about me?

## JOHN:
It’s so late.
I’m so tired.
I love you.
You’re my best friend.

Hey.

Hey.

Genevieve, oh, my God!
I’m stuck in Plano.

## GENEVIEVE:
What?
---
## STEVE:
I’m stuck in Plano.
--

## GENEVIEVE:
No you’re not.
---
## STEVE:
Yes, I am.
I need your help.
I didn’t know who else to call.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Shut up.
I don’t want to talk to you.

## GENEVIEVE:
I’m having a me day.

Fucking asshole.

## STEVE:
HEY!
Did you throw away my *soap*?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
What?
What are you doing here?
--

## STEVE:
Trying to wash up.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
You just called me from Plano.
---
## STEVE:
No, I didn’t.
--

## GENEVIEVE:
Yes, you did.
---
## STEVE:
No, I didn’t.
See?
I don’t even know how to use this thing.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
What the fuck are you doing?
--

## STEVE:
What the fuck are you doing?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Are the kids in the car?
I thought you were taking the kids to the movies.
Go be a dad.
---
## STEVE:
Okay.
Duty, y’all!
---
## STEVE:
I say y’all now, even though I’m from Long Island.
But where’s my soap?
---
## STEVE:
Oops, I’m looking at my garage, where I still have all my ideas for songs.
---
## STEVE:
Remember that funny joke I told Anne?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Yes, that was funny.
Now stop fucking with me and leave.
Okay?
--

## STEVE:
Okay.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Leave.
---
## STEVE:
Oh, okay well—hey, wait, HEY!
I’m scared and stupid and begging you to love me.
--

## GENEVIEVE:
Leave.

## STEVE:
Oh.

GET OFF THE PHONE.

## STEVE:
I’M NOT ON THE PHONE.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
What?
--

## STEVE:
What?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
You’re in the house.
I just saw you, you’re here.
---
## STEVE:
No, I’m stuck in Plano.
Please help me.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Steve.
Steve!
You’re here.
You’re in the house.
---
## STEVE:
No, that’s not me.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
It is you, I just saw you.
---
## STEVE:
You’re freaking me out.
--

## GENEVIEVE:
You’re freaking *me* out.
---
## STEVE:
You’re being crazy.
--

## GENEVIEVE:
*Steve*?
---
## STEVE:
I’ll find it!
--

## GENEVIEVE:
Did you hear that?
---
## STEVE:
That must be your other husband.
Haha.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
What, so there’s two yous?
---
## STEVE:
There must be.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
What, so you split in half?
---
## STEVE:
I must have.
What did you do?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
I didn’t do anything, Jesus, I don’t know anything, I don’t know how to know anything
---
## STEVE:
Just come rescue me.
I’m in Plano.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Steve, why are you in Plano?
---
## STEVE:
I’m just in Plano.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Why were you in Plano?
---
## STEVE:
I’m sitting in my car.

---
## STEVE:
I took the kids to a movie.

---
## STEVE:
They were *happy*.
And what did I do?

---
## STEVE:
Annihilated them all with my grumpiness.
---
## STEVE:
They’ll never forget my forever grumpiness, the way I look passed them,
---
## STEVE:
and through them, the way I annihilate them,
---
## STEVE:
their annihilation of me, any time they look over and wonder where I went.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
You’re having a panic attack.
---
## STEVE:
No, I’m just in Plano.
--

## GENEVIEVE:
Stop saying Plano, I hate Plano.
---
## STEVE:
Everyone hates Plano.
But Plano has happened to me.
---
## STEVE:
I’ve undergone a Plano.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Are the kids with you?
--

## STEVE:
Yeah, they’re uh, yeah.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
You’re doing this in front of them?
---
## STEVE:
What?
No.
I’m doing this inside of you.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Are you there with Jillian?
Steve?
---
## STEVE:
…Yes?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
I don’t want to help you.
---
## STEVE:
Why not?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
I hate you.
--

## STEVE:
Do you?
No.
Why?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
You scare me.
---
## STEVE:
Why?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Why?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
*Why*?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
You hit me.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
It was weird.
It was weird when you hit me.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
It was gross, you were like—
You were gross and sobbing, haha.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
And then your wrist went like a slug against the wall.
And you wailed like a little kitten.
We both hated it.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
We had sex and I wanted to die, I thought about dying
during our sex,
---
## GENEVIEVE:
I think about dying all the time, I didn’t
leave the bed today.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
I don’t know how to tell anyone what’s going on.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
How even though you “left,” you’re still everywhere.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
I imagine you walking around Dallas, your new hair,
your new clothes.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Your little dumb girlfriends.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
The, uh…
Haha the image.
Steve at large, Steve on the town.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
You’re a peacock.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
You make your fucking mirror face.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
You make your fucking mirror face even when you’re not looking in the mirror.
---
## STEVE:
Where is my soap?!
Where’d the soap go, you ass?!
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Plus I already have one Steve to deal with.
You’re in my bathroom.
---
## STEVE:
No, Genevieve listen, I just wanted to be beautiful,
---
## STEVE:
I wanted to be beautiful for *you*, and instead I kept waking up soggy garbage, so I changed,
---
## STEVE:
and now this is me, and whatever you’re talking to over there isn’t me,
---
## STEVE:
he’s in your head because you’ve always been a little like this, but it’s okay, okay?
I love you.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
I have to go, I need my sisters, they’re coming over.
---
## STEVE:
Oh, God, fuck, Genevieve, fuck you.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Thanks for coming over.
Thanks.
--

## ISABEL:
Of course.
---
## ANNE:
Hey, yeah.
--

## GENEVIEVE:
Hey, thank you.
---
## ISABEL:
Hey, hey, sisters and friends.
--

## ANNE:
Sisters and friends.
---
## ISABEL:
Where’s Steve?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
He’s in Plano.
Why, what?
--

## ISABEL:
What?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
What?
Can’t we just have a *conversation*?
---
## ANNE:
What happened?
--

## GENEVIEVE:
Nothing.
What?
---
## ISABEL:
Oh, no.
What is it?
--

## GENEVIEVE:
Nothing, I’ll tell you later.
---
## ANNE:
It’s later.
--

## GENEVIEVE:
What?
No it’s not.
It’s still now.
---
## ANNE:
Oh, weird.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Eat some hummus.
Eat it, eat it, eat some of
this hummus.
---
## ISABEL:
I’m not hungry.
--

## GENEVIEVE:
Fucking eat, though, eat some of the hummus.

---
## GENEVIEVE:
Please? I made it.
---
## ISABEL:
Let me get drunker.
--

## GENEVIEVE:
Eat it, don’t be anorexic.
---

## ISABEL:
I’m *not* oh, my gosh.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
It’s good I put, uh…
--

## ANNE:
I’ll have some.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
I put garlic.
--

## ISABEL:
I’m not anorexic.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
You totally are.
--

## ISABEL:
No I’m just undiagnosably ill.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Forever and ever, Amen.
--

## STEVE:
You are an enemy of the weird.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Shut the fuck up.
Go inside.
Go inside.
Now.
---
## ISABEL:
What was that?
--

## GENEVIEVE:
Nothing.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Let’s just talk about any little thing.
Talk as though your life depended on it.
Now.
---
## ISABEL:
I made a friend.
At church.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
What?
Why?
You have too many friends.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Don’t—don’t—I mean, a *friend*?
Fuck.
---
## ANNE:
I heard that if you make your bed every day, you’ll be less depressed.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
I heard that, too.
---
## ANNE:
So I’ve been trying to make my bed every day.
--

## GENEVIEVE:
Me too.
Thank you.
---
## ANNE:
Yeah, and it’s been helping a little.
---
## ISABEL:
Are you guys depressed?
--

## GENEVIEVE:
Fuck, Isabel.
---
## ISABEL:
What?
--

## GENEVIEVE:
Seriously!
---
## ISABEL:
What’s wrong?
--

## GENEVIEVE:
Nothing.
Talk about anything.
---
## ANNE:
Can I tell you my big thing?
--

## GENEVIEVE:
Yes.
---
## ANNE:
I have a slug infestation in my apartment.
Slugs.
---
## ISABEL:
What?
You have slugs?
---
## ANNE:
They’re creatures from Hell.
I’m living in Hell.
---
## ANNE:
Every morning I wake up to sticky tracks across the kitchen.
---
## ANNE:
Sometimes I find one lying with its pasty belly up because it couldn’t move its bestial fat body any further.
---
## ANNE:
Last night I found a four-inch fucker in my coffee mug.
---
## ANNE:
Just oozing an ooze.
---
## ANNE:
But the worst was when I got up to go to the bathroom at 3 a.m.
---
## ANNE:
When I came back, I noticed something where I had been sleeping.
It was a fucking slug.
---
## ANNE:
I HAD BEEN SLEEPING ON A FUCKING SLUG.
---
## ANNE:
Fucking treating me like its comfort rock.
---
## ANNE:
These things think they’re *safe* with me.
---
## ISABEL:
Oh my gosh.
--

## ANNE:
Yeah.
--

## GENEVIEVE:
Salt.
---
## ISABEL:
Oh my gosh, Anne.
--

## GENEVIEVE:
Salt.
---
## ISABEL:
You poor thing.
--

## ANNE:
Yeah, yeah whatever.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Salt.
Salt every seam of your house.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
They must be getting in through the fireplaces somehow—
---
## GENEVIEVE:
but it helped when we salted down into the cracks around the fireplace that led under the house.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Then we duct taped the cracks as well.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Slugs can get in through any sized crack.
So just seal everything.
---
## ISABEL:
You had slugs, too?
---
## ANNE:
When did you have slugs?
--

## GENEVIEVE:
I didn’t, I mean I just did, it was earlier, don’t worry about it.
---
## ANNE:
Okay, thank you.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
You will get through this.
--

## ANNE:
Thank you.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Why isn’t John helping you with the slugs?
---
## ANNE:
He is, he is, he’s just afraid of them, and he doesn’t know about them,
---
## ANNE:
I haven’t told him yet, he has his own room.
---
## ISABEL:
Do you think the slugs might be some sort of spiritual metaphor?
--

## GENEVIEVE:
Isabel.
---
## ISABEL:
Y’all I want to write a poem about these slugs!
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Isabel you’re so bad at conversation.
I want to strangle you.
---
## ISABEL:
Oh.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
When you’re with your sisters, when you’re all together, what’s good is to talk about nightmares.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
I mean memories.
Right?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Can’t we all agree?
---
## ISABEL:
Nightmares or memories?
--

## GENEVIEVE:
Memories.
---
## ANNE:
Memories, yeah.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
I just remembered when we were kids and we all got food poisoning from bad pizza and we started vomiting
---
## GENEVIEVE:
and it became a chain reaction of vomiting all the way down the staircase and it made Dad cry.
---
## ISABEL:
Oh, yeah I just remembered sitting on the sidewalk in fifth grade at recess and praying
---
## ISABEL:
and then walking down the hill to a clearing just below the freeway
---
## ISABEL:
and crouching and staying very still and hoping to see God, or a deer,
---
## ISABEL:
or God in deer-form—
---
## ANNE:
I just remembered—
---
## STEVE:
I just remembered catching bees from the rhododendrons behind my house
---
## STEVE:
with my brother and two kids from up the street whose names I do not remember.
---
## STEVE:
We snap them tight in brightly colored plastic cubes that fold open on their diagonals.
---
## STEVE:
Once the bees are trapped inside, we hold them to our ears to hear them buzz.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Look, don’t worry, pals.
That isn’t the real Steve.
---
## ANNE:
What do you mean?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
It’s a different Steve.
--

## ISABEL:
What?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
The real Steve is with the kids.
Don’t worry.
---
## ISABEL:
I’m worrying.
--

## GENEVIEVE:
Me too.
---
## ANNE:
There are two Steves?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
All I know is Steve took the kids this afternoon.
And then he calls and he’s on the phone, right?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
In Plano?
And then he walks out of the bathroom?
My bathroom.
Here.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
And then he follows me around the house, standing too close.
So I texted my kids, right?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
And they’re definitely with their dad right now.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
So I dunno how else to say it: now there are two Steves.
---
## ANNE:
I’m going to have a heart attack.
---
## ISABEL:
We should call a priest.
--

## GENEVIEVE:
No.
A fucking priest?
Okay, *Mom*.
---
## ANNE:
We do need to do something about it.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Maybe a little later we’ll do something about it.
---

## ANNE:
It’s later.
--

## GENEVIEVE:
No it’s *not*, Anne!
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Right now I just want to
be here with you on my fucking porch!
Okay?
---
## ANNE:
Okay.
--

## GENEVIEVE:
Okay?
--

## ISABEL:
Okay.
---
## ISABEL: <i>(slowly and clearly)</i>
Are you okay?
Hi.
Are you okay?
---

## GENEVIEVE: <i>(quietly)</i>
Isabel…
--

## ISABEL:
What?
---
## GENEVIEVE: <i>(quietly)</i>
Don’t fucking try to make this Steve into a friend, Isabel.
Don’t you fucking dare!
---
## ISABEL:
I’m sorry.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
What the fuck is wrong with you!
--

## ISABEL:
I’m sorry!
He looked sad!
---
## ANNE:
Genevieve, I have to say…
--

## GENEVIEVE:
Anne?
---
## ANNE:
Sorry but—
--

## GENEVIEVE:
No.
---
## ANNE:
It reminds me of my theory.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Do not intellectualize this.
--

## ANNE:
Can’t help it.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Let’s talk about hopes for the future.
---
## ANNE:
Isabel might be right about the slugs.
--

## GENEVIEVE:
What?
---
## ANNE:
I’ve always felt like we’re cursed, like we’re trapped… The red ribbon.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Fuck you, Anne.
---
## ISABEL:
What’s the red ribbon?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Nothing.
--

## ANNE:
It’s when we were kids.
---
## ISABEL:
A thing happened?
Why didn’t you tell me?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Because we’re not allowed to talk about the past.
There’s no such thing as a meaningful past!
---
## ANNE:
It’s earlier.
We’re kids.
Isabel you’re a baby.
---
## ANNE:
We live in that house on Berkeley Street—Dad is gone on a trip to Santa Fe—and we’re playing,
---
## ANNE:
and we see, we all see a red ribbon snake down the staircase,
---
## ANNE:
slow, step by step, like this.
---
## ANNE:
We watch it go all the way down.
---
## ANNE:
Then Mom grabs it and burns it in the backyard.
---
## ANNE:
And that day lasts for thirty years.
---
## ANNE:
And why is Dad always gone?
---
## ANNE:
And why has Mom been so hard on us?
---
## ANNE:
And even though Dad is away in Santa Fe, why do we swear we see him one day,
---
## ANNE:
laughing and screaming through the upstairs bathroom window?
---
template: noise

---
## ISABEL:
Y’all, God is so real.
--

## GENEVIEVE:
Isabel, get out of my house.
---
## ANNE:
But it’s true.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Anne, get out of my house.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Sorry.
No.
Stay here.
I just—fuck.
---
## ANNE:
But listen, lives have *form*, curses have *form*, but the form disintegrates,
---
## ANNE:
and every moment either multiplies or disappears.

---
## ANNE:
And so do we.

---
## ANNE:
Like there’s a reason I have huge gaps in my memory.

---
## ANNE:
Like we’re ghosts of ourselves, like we’re dying and coming back,
---
## ANNE:
over and over again, and when we come back, we’re a

---
## ANNE:
little warped, a little stranger, and there’s no way out, we’re trapped in a disintegrating loop.

---
## ANNE:
I’ve always felt like that, it’s my theory.
--

## GENEVIEVE:
I hate that theory.
---
## ANNE:
Well, let’s look at the evidence—
---
template: noise
Isabel gasps
---
## GENEVIEVE:
What?
---
## ISABEL:
Steve is *different*.
---
## ISABEL:
Look at him, it’s like he’s dead.
---
## ISABEL:
And he was so nice.
---
## ISABEL:
He used to play the piano and make people laugh.
---
## ISABEL:
He was my friend.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
That isn’t the real Steve.
---
## ISABEL:
But I don’t believe that.
---
## ISABEL:
I don’t think there are really two Steves—there’s still *one* Steve right?
---
## ISABEL:
I mean even if there’s two bodies.
Right?
---
## ISABEL:
Somewhere there’s still *one* Steve-soul experiencing all of this?
---
## ISABEL:
And I’m just feeling so—I’m feeling so sad for him and he’s in so much pain.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
What the fuck are you talking about?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
What the fuck is wrong with you?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
I don’t want this to be about Steve.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
I don’t want this to be about there being two Steves.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
I don’t want this to be about there being two Steves in so much pain.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Why should there be two Steves?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
I wish there were zero Steves.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
I wish there had never been a Steve.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
None of his college stubble and his whiskey bottles and his iPhone and
---
## GENEVIEVE:
I wish there’d never been that fucking Norwegian book.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
What’s it called?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
The one that enabled him?
About the white guy struggling?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
It’s *obvious*, Anne, that the red ribbon happened because Dad was cheating on Mom.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
He had five fucking affairs.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
He opened up a portal and ushered in the demonic.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Duh duh duh duh duh.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
We’re cursed.
Duh.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
I wish when I looked to the future I saw me standing alone with the things I’ve made.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
I wish I could break through to anything else.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
I can, I can, I can, I know I can.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
I’ve been working on a sculpture.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
The sculpture is about things leaning on other things, the ways things lean on other things.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
It’s also a sculpture about losing everything you had, even the things you still have.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
I have a hangover straight out of Hell, guys.
I can’t lose anyone else.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
I don’t even know if that’s what I’m worried about.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
How do you love the place you are?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
I never feel good.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Why am I the only one falling apart?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Why is everyone allowed to watch?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Anne, you need to take better care of yourself.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
You’re disappearing.
You’re weird.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
I forget you’re there when I’m with you.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Isabel, you’re not a peacekeeper, you’re slippery.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
You’re too nice to everyone.
No one believes you.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
You need to find something good to do alone.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
People will start disappearing and then who will you be—
---
## STEVE:
Oh, and Isabel, and your kindness makes you seem stupid
---
## STEVE:
and your faith makes you seem stupid
---
## STEVE:
and I can see your backne through the top of your shirt
---
## STEVE:
and I think your chronic illness is psychosomatic
---
## STEVE:
because you want someone to love you but they won’t love you
---
## STEVE:
if you don’t let them fuck you
---
## STEVE:
because your saintly virginity is repulsive to them, right, Genevieve?
---
## STEVE:
We talked about this!
---
## STEVE:
And Anne, you are getting so droopy you are getting so droopy,
---
## STEVE:
you are dull and droopy and dull and droopy and people sigh when your name comes up
---
## STEVE:
because your name carries a smelly loneliness
---
## STEVE:
and people shake their heads when they talk about you—
--

## GENEVIEVE:
STOP IT.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
That isn’t—
He’s not speaking for—
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Anne, you’re beautiful.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
We sigh and shake our heads because you’re so beautiful,
---
## GENEVIEVE:
and you’re the best conversationalist in the world,
---
## GENEVIEVE:
you’re so solicitous and brilliant and you’re living your life and you’re a badass.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
And Isabel, your faith makes you seem wise, you’re wiser than any of us,
---
## GENEVIEVE:
you’re basically a living saint.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
And
you’re beautiful.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
And when you find love it’s going to make us all jealous because it’s going to be spiritual and sexy and perfect and…

Don’t listen to Steve, don’t let him make sounds, let’s let him go,

Aw, you care.

Of course, Steve.

You were always nice to me.

## ISABEL:
Of course Steve, I’m sorry, how horrible.

What is?

To, I dunno, to die when you’re still alive?
You’ll get better.

## STEVE:
What do I do?

About what?

## STEVE:
About how sad.

## ISABEL:
What about how sad?

About how white.

What about how white?

About my belly.

What about your belly?

Oh.

About my hair.

What about your hair?

I love Genevieve, she’s great, but you don’t know, I was the golden one,

I was a prestigious Dallas cultural gatekeeper,

## STEVE:
I could talk forever about anything, I was so good at debating your mom,

## STEVE:
and now Genevieve is suddenly smarter than me,

## STEVE:
and she’s getting more successful than me, a little bit every day,

“wow she’s honestly the most fierce and radiant person I’ve ever met,”

and I’m like yeah, I’m like that’s *awesome*, and I’m like I hate her,

I’m like you don’t know what she’s really like, she carves things into my—trying

I’m in Play D’oh.

## STEVE:
I’m in a play, no, it’s about my odyssey back from Plano.
---
## STEVE:
My odyssey back from Plano takes so long, I meet so many characters and learn so much about myself.
---
## STEVE:
Why doesn’t anyone care about my odyssey back from Plano?

## STEVE:
And then when you come back you come back a stranger?

It’s later.
Steve split in two.

Oh, no, Genevieve and Steve.

## ANNE:
Those poor kids.

## ANNE:
I killed Steve with *My Struggle: Book One* but I actually quite like Knausgård.

## ANNE:
Hey, John?
---
## ANNE:
Hey, John, Björk’s coming to town, we should go see Björk in concert later.
---
## ANNE:
It’s later.
It’s okay, I’m sure she’ll come back.

## ANNE:
Thanks for—

## JOHN:
Okay.
---
## ANNE:
Isabel’s going back to Chicago, we should take Isabel to dinner later.

It’s later.
Wasn’t she different?

## JOHN:
She was different and darker.
---
## ANNE:
Thanks for doing the dishes.

## ANNE:
You know what?
You should—

## JOHN:
I would love to.

## ANNE:
I’ve been thinking about recurrences.
About.

## ANNE:
Borges.

## ANNE:
“The Garden of Forking Paths.” Do you know about that?

## JOHN:
If only you knew!
If only you knew!
---
## JOHN:
The strangest American joy of my adventures in Plano!
--

## ANNE:
Tell me.
---
## JOHN:
I’m starting to go gray a little, at the temples!
---
## JOHN:
I’m starting to worship every moment, in and out in
and out.

## JOHN:
Won’t I be the cutest old man?

## JOHN:
And you with your books.

## JOHN:
And Javier Greg, making our jaws drop open, our son
is so funny.

I’m so tired.
You’re my best friend.

John.

Yes, lover?

Um, we have slugs.
Have you noticed the slugs?
---
## ANNE:
I need help with the slugs.
--

## JOHN:
I have to go.
---
## ANNE:
I think my family is cursed, did I tell you this
already?
---
## JOHN:
What do you mean?
---
## ANNE:
I think we have a curse.
We’ve been cursed.
---
## ANNE:
Someone cursed us and the curse is working.
---
## JOHN:
A curse would be bad.
--

## ANNE:
Yeah.
---
## JOHN:
Depending on the curse.
---
## ANNE:
I think it was a bad curse.
I think the slugs are a part of it.
---
## JOHN:
Oh, no, a bad curse.
---
## JOHN:
The way to get through a curse is to pretend there is no
curse, okay?
---
## ANNE:
Okay.
---
## JOHN:
Goodnight.
---
## ANNE:
You look handsome.
--

## JOHN:
Thank you.
---
## ANNE:
I like your hair.

## JOHN:
Oh, thank you.

Is your family cursed at all?
---
## JOHN:
Yes.

## ANNE:
Sleep in my bed tonight.

Maybe, I don’t want to snore.
---
## ANNE:
You don’t snore.
--

## JOHN:
But you do.

## ANNE:
I won’t snore.

## JOHN:
Maybe.

## ANNE:
Is your family really cursed?

## JOHN:
Very much.
---
## ANNE:
What’s the curse?
---
## JOHN:
Our feet get smaller and smaller.
---
## ANNE:
Really, why?
---
## JOHN:
For the way my grandfather walked through town.
---
## ANNE:
How did he walk through town?
---
## JOHN:
I don’t know.
---
## JOHN:
But someone hated it.
--

## ANNE:
They hated it.
---
## JOHN:
They just hated it.
---
## ANNE:
And now your feet get smaller.
--

## JOHN:
Now our feet get smaller and smaller.
---
## ANNE:
Your mother’s feet are small I noticed.
---
## JOHN:
And getting smaller.
--

## ANNE:
And your sister, I did notice that.
---
## JOHN:
Too small.
---
## JOHN:
It hurts me.
She’s so strong and yet the feet get smaller.
---
## JOHN:
Do you want me to apologize to you?
---
## ANNE:
Oh.
About what?
---
## JOHN:
About me.
About the way I walk through town.
---
## JOHN:
About my badness.
--

## ANNE:
What about your badness?
---
## JOHN:
The way I am a bad husband.
--

## ANNE:
What about it?
---
## JOHN:
The way I am quiet.
And disappear.
---
## ANNE:
You know that you do that?
--

## JOHN:
Of course I know, yes.
---
## JOHN:
Yes.
We’re all bad, all of us.
---
## ANNE:
Who’s bad?
All men?
---
## JOHN:
Oh, no.
All the Me’s.
---
## ANNE:
There are more of you?
---
## JOHN:
Yes, but I keep them invisible.
So don’t worry.
---
## ANNE:
I’m worried.
Where are they?
---
## JOHN:
All around.
Everywhere.
---
## JOHN:
But you’ll never need to know where they go.
---
## ANNE:
Where do they go?
---
## JOHN:
They go to—
--

## ANNE:
Plano, I know.
But where exactly?
---
## JOHN:
They, oh—

## JOHN:
They head west on Davis.
---
## JOHN:
They turn right on Tyler.
---
## JOHN:
They continue on Sylvan.

## JOHN:
They turn right on I-30 East.

## JOHN:
They stay in the right lane.

## JOHN:
They get on Spur 366 East.

## JOHN:
They keep left for I-35 East.

They use the left two lanes for 75 North.
They stay on that for 17 miles.

They take exit 29A for Park Blvd.
They turn right on 18th St.

## JOHN:
They turn right on K Ave.
Destination will be on the left.

Alright?

…Alright.

## ANNE:
And last thing…

## ANNE:
Which, yeah…

## ANNE:
There’s so much that I can be okay with, about this,
really, John.
---
## ANNE:
Our rhythm is lovely, and our son is loved.
---
## ANNE:
There’s just this one absurd thing—one little absurdity
that I need to banish from my psyche.
---
## ANNE:
Which is, yeah…

## ANNE:
Just that I’ve been feeling repulsive to you.

And yeah…

Am I repulsive to you?

No.
None.

You’re not allowed to do this.

Here’s some secret knowledge.

You’re just the ground

Oh my god, was it a dream?
---
## ISABEL:
I guess so, I don’t know.
---
## ANNE:
Are you okay?
---
## ISABEL:
I guess so, I don’t know.
Can I call Genevieve in?
---
## ANNE:
Of course.
---
## JOHN:
Hey, you’re up.
---
## ANNE:
Isabel called me.
---
## JOHN:
Isabel!
No!
I’m so sorry, Isabel!
---
## ISABEL:
For what?
---
## JOHN:
Oh, Isabel!
---
## ISABEL:
I had a dream about you.
---
## ANNE:
He’s gone.
---
## ISABEL:
Oh.
Genevieve didn’t answer.
---
## ANNE:
Must be asleep.
Are you okay?
---
## ISABEL:
Yeah, I just got so scared.
I feel it, and I saw it.
---
## ANNE:
Saw what?
---
## ISABEL:
What was gonna happen.
---
## ANNE:
What’s gonna happen?
---
## ISABEL:
He’s gonna sit on me until I break.
---
## ANNE:
Who is?
---
## ISABEL:
God.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
What’s going on?
---
## ISABEL:
I’m having a scary night.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Me too.
---
## ISABEL:
You are?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Yeah.
I had to know.
I got the shovel.
The body was still in the backyard.
We must have really dug a hole.
He wasn’t dead.
He was just in there.
Blinking like a baby.
You’re tracking dirt everywhere.
Stop it.
---
## STEVE:
Who are you talking to?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Isabel.
---
## ISABEL:
Who are you talking to?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Second Steve.
---
## ISABEL:
Is he there?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Yeah.
---
## JOHN:
Goodnight.
---
## ANNE:
Goodnight.
Where’d you go tonight?
---
## JOHN:
Plano.
And someone told me the most wonderful joke.
Goodnight.
---
## ANNE:
Goodnight.
Will I see you for breakfast?
---
## JOHN:
Have to get up early.
Oh, your mother wrote me an e-mail.
---
## ANNE:
What did it say?

---
## JOHN:
Goodnight.
---
## ANNE:
Goodnight.
---
## ISABEL:
Are you leaving, Anne?
---
## ANNE:
No that was John.
---
## ISABEL:
Hi John.
Can we—
---
## ANNE:
He’s gone.
---
## ISABEL:
Genevieve, can I see this Steve?
Hi, Second Steve.
Do you remember when you told me—
---
## STEVE:
Who’s that with you?
---
## ISABEL:
What?
---
## STEVE:
Who’s that with you?
---
## ISABEL:
I’m alone.
---
## STEVE:
There’s someone with you.
---
## ISABEL:
No there isn’t.
---
## STEVE:
I’m so sorry.
---
## ISABEL:
For what?
---
## STEVE:
He’s with you.
---
## ISABEL:
Who is?
---
## STEVE:
I’m sorry.
---
## ISABEL:
Who is?
Who is?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Don’t go into the kids’ rooms, Second Steve!
The other you’s supposed to be in Denver this week!
---
## ISABEL:
Hey, do you see anyone with me?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
No.
---
## ANNE:
No.
---
## ISABEL:
I want to be there.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Come back.
You can live with me.
---
## ANNE:
Just come back.
You can live with me.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Don’t live with Anne, her apartment is tiny and she has slugs.
---
## ANNE:
Yeah, you should live with her, not me.
AHHHH!
Sorry, slug.
---
## ISABEL:
Anne, are you gonna move out?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Yeah, Anne you should move out.
---
## ANNE:
I will when Greg’s out of kindergarten.
---
## ISABEL:
Who’s Greg?
You mean Javier Greg?
---
## ANNE:
Oh, his teacher called him Greg, so he’s Greg now.
---
## ISABEL:
Oh, no, she Americanized him?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Is that weird for him?
---
## ANNE:
He’s very comfortable with the duality.
He already speaks two languages.
He’s the smartest thing, my little trickster god, my little Odyssean polytropos.
AHHHH!
Sorry, slug.
---
## ISABEL:
I’m scared, y’all.
I got so comfortable with God but then He changed, He changed.
And I had a nightmare that I wouldn’t have a husband or kids.
I want to have a husband and kids.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Why?
---
## ANNE:
Yes why do you want that?
---
## ISABEL:
Because I want to give and give and give.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
You do, you will.
---
## ANNE:
All it does is take, anyway.
And you’re never alone.
Having a family is just a haunting.
---
## ISABEL:
But it’s what I want.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Isabel—come home.
Don’t fuck up your life.
---
## ANNE:
Or do.
---
## ISABEL:
What?
---
## ANNE:
Fuck it up—who cares.
---
## ISABEL:
Can we stop talking about him?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
About who?
---
## ISABEL:
Yeah, can we, can we just stop talking about him?
---
## ANNE:
Who’s him?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Are you okay?
---
## ISABEL:
Oh, just my—
Oh, I’ll call back later.
---
## ANNE:
When, what?
---
## ISABEL:
Now.
Hey, uh.
I moved in with you.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Yes, yay, I love you, you’re gonna be okay, can you babysit tonight?
---
## ISABEL:
Yeah, and now I snuck out hoping to get hit by a car.
---
## ANNE:
Can you babysit tonight?
---
## ISABEL:
Yeah, and now I woke up sobbing, about to drink Plano.
I mean Drano!
Oops!
Anyway it feels right to be back.
And yeah I’ve been trying to make my bed every day.
And yeah it’s been helping a little.
Okay, goodnight.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Goodnight.
---
## ANNE:
Goodnight.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
I told the other Steve about you.
---
## SECOND STEVE:
You did?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Yes, he’s coming to meet you.
---
## SECOND STEVE:
He is?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Yeah, so that’ll be interesting.
---
## SECOND STEVE:
Oh, no, Genevieve, how could you?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
What?
---
## SECOND STEVE:
That’s scary.
I’m scared.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Well, I’m sorry, but he’ll be here any second.
---
## SECOND STEVE:
Lock the door.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Lock the door?
---
## SECOND STEVE:
Lock the door, I’m scared.
I don’t want to meet him.

Let me in Genevieve.

## SECOND STEVE:
Oh, no, I’m scared.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Sorry, hold on.
---
## FIRST STEVE:
Fuck, fuck, let me in.
---
## SECOND STEVE:
Tell him it’s going to scare him
---
## GENEVIEVE:
It’s going to scare you!
---
## FIRST STEVE:
I don’t care.
Let me in.
---
## SECOND STEVE:
I’m scared.
Don’t let him in.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
He’s scared.
---
## FIRST STEVE:
I don’t care.
---
## SECOND STEVE:
No no no.
Please Genevieve.
Tell that Steve to *go away*!
---
## GENEVIEVE:
He says “go away.”
---
## FIRST STEVE:
I’m not gonna go away.
Let me in or I’ll break this door down.
Hey.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Hey.
---
## FIRST STEVE:
Where is he?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
He sunk into there.
---
## FIRST STEVE:
He sunk into there?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Just sunk down into there.
---
## FIRST STEVE:
Should I go in there?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
If you want to see him.
Hey, Boy Assistant.
I just want to talk about business.
Okay, great.
The biennial?
Great.
Yup.
I’ll fucking e-mail him, tell him to calm down.
Okay, bye Boy Assistant.
Thanks for talking to me about business.
---
## STEVE:
Oh my god.
How long was I in there?
How many hours?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Like thirty seconds.
---
## STEVE:
What?
No.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Are you okay?
---
## STEVE:
I don’t know.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
What’d you see?
---
## STEVE:
He’s in there.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Yeah.
---
## STEVE:
He’s me.
And I looked at him and touched him.
He’s so sad and complicated—and, aw, yeah, he’s actually
really sweet.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
He’s not sweet.
---
## STEVE:
I think he’s actually really sweet.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Wait, which one are you?
---
## STEVE:
What… I’m the normal one, the first one.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
But you weren’t wearing that shirt.
---
## STEVE:
What?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
You’re wearing some of his clothes.
Did y’all trade clothes?
---
## STEVE:
No
What?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Jesus Christ.
---
## STEVE:
Listen, I’d like to be able to visit this Steve sometimes.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Ugh.
---
## STEVE:
What?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
I don’t know.
I don’t even know if I want to keep him.
You can just have him.
---
## STEVE:
I don’t want to have him.
I want to visit him on occasion.
Are you feeding him?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
He’s feeding himself.
---
## STEVE:
Okay, good.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
He eats a lot.
---
## STEVE:
Okay, good.
Okay, this is okay.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
What is?
---
## STEVE:
We talked it out?
And there’s something really nice about this.
It’s nice to have two of oneself.
He’ll be the one who eats, I’ll be the one who’s skinny.
He’ll be the dad, I’ll be the genius.
And he’ll be here, and I’ll be everywhere else.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
I don’t want him here.
I thought he could be an art object, but he’s not an art
object.
I carve things into his skin and he doesn’t die.
---
## STEVE:
Don’t do that!
Don’t carve things into his skin!
Don’t you fucking dare!
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Leave!
---
## STEVE:
And tell your mom to stop calling me!
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Shut the fuck up!
Wait, what?
My mom’s calling you?
---
## STEVE:
Yeah, tell her to stop mothering me!
I already have a mother!
---
## GENEVIEVE:
*Leave*!

## GENEVIEVE:
Are you dying?
---
## ANNE:
I’ll call an ambulance.
---
## ISABEL:
No wait.
No no listen.
Shhh.
Okay.
I’m not dying.
Um so…
Don’t laugh but uhh…
I think I’m a saint.
I didn’t ask for this to happen but I think I’m a saint.
---
## ANNE:
A saint?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Jesus Christ.
---
## ISABEL:
Do not disparage me, Genevieve.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
I’m not.
---
## ISABEL:
I’m not trying to make a big deal out of it, but yes, I think I’m being called to sainthood and anyway it’s not glamorous, it actually hurts so much, I think he pulled out my entrails.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Okay, well have fun being a *saint*, fuck …
---
## ANNE:
I’m happy for you, Isabel, unless this is bad news
---
## ISABEL:
It’s not good news or bad news, it’s just realism.
Oh, I forgot to read y’all my poem about the slugs.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Oh, you wrote that?
---
## ANNE:
Is it good?
---
## ISABEL:
Yeah, this is it:
There’s something bad in my body.
It’s multiplying & disappearing & coming back.
All the
time.
And then when you come back you come back a
stranger.
The one who made us is coming back.
The one who made us is coming back a stranger.
This is so uncomfortable.
It’s okay, just give it all to me.
All the discomfort in the world.
I’ll be discomfort’s comfort rock.

I’m not here—Anne, you’re here—honey what’s
wrong?

Anne, you’re standing in the corner of my room,

Oh, Lord/
Y’all um…

Um…
I don’t know.
Just now.

Are you okay?

Yes, why?
Shhh.

Have you been crying?

Yes, but don’t worry.

You seem out of breath.

Oh, I tried to freshen up.

Mom, why were you crying?

I don’t know!
Hush!

Where are you going, sit down.

## MARY:
I don’t know.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
You don’t know?
---
## MARY:
I’m just exhausted.
…from all the…driving.
---
## ANNE:
Where are you coming from?
---
## MARY:
Shhh I’m coming from *You Without Me* in the other
room, to rush in and put a washcloth on your head, to
break the fever.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
What fever?
---
## MARY:
Your poor little fevers.
You poor babies.
---
## ISABEL:
We’re not babies.
---
## MARY:
You’re three little babies.
You’re three little Me’s.
No you’re not three little Me’s.
You’re three little You’s.
---
## ISABEL:
We’re not little anythings.
---
## ANNE:
You never treated us like little kids.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
You treated us like nuns in your convent.
---
## MARY:
Shhh I know, I know, but I helped with your fevers.
OH NO!
---
## ISABEL:
WHAT?
---
## ANNE:
Jesus.

## GENEVIEVE:
Mom.

## MARY:
Okay, shhh shhh shhh.

I’m so afraid.

Going back to where I am, with them.

Hi, okay, I’m here.

Yes, yes.
Are we crying?
Are we all crying?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
No, Mom what’s—
---
## MARY:
Hi, please don’t ask me any questions.
I want to help.
You and you and you.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
No, don’t help us—we want to help *you*.
---
## MARY:
Shhh, no no, I’m here to help, I have to help.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Then help Isabel.
---
## ISABEL:
What?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
You need to talk to Mom, you’re sick.
---
## ISABEL:
No I don’t, she doesn’t believe me, neither does Dad.
---
## MARY:
Hush!
He’ll hear you.
---
## ISABEL:
Dad’s here?
---
## MARY:
He’s inside.
He’s feeling sad.
He has the dark wing of sadness.
The dark wing of sadness has descended upon him.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Ugh.
---
## ANNE:
I’ll text John to pick up whiskey, that always makes
Dad feel better.
---
## MARY:
How *is* John, Anne?
You need your intellectual equal?
---
## ANNE:
He is my intellectual equal.
---
## MARY:
But do you have a *friendship*?
You should be married in the *church*.
---
## ANNE:
Don’t worry.
---
## MARY:
Did he leave you?
---
## ANNE:
What, no, he’s wonderful, he gave me directions
---
## MARY:
Genevieve, why are you doing that with your hands?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
I’m not doing anything with my hands.
You’re the one doing something with your hands.
---
## MARY:
Shhh—are you on the verge of a nervous breakdown?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Stop it Mom I’m past the point of a nervous breakdown.
I’m going to break into crystals and set fires everywhere I go.
---
## MARY:
We called Steve, and he wept.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
He’s always weeping, why did you call him?
---
## MARY:
The hearts of men are naked baby rats.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
No they’re not, stop calling him
---
## MARY:
Naked baby rats.
They need you.
They’re pink.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
WHY DID YOU COME HERE?
---
## MARY:
HUSH!!!!!
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Jesus Christ.
Why do we have to be quiet?
---
## MARY:
They’ll hear us.
---
## ISABEL:
Who, you’re scaring us?
---
## MARY:
It doesn’t matter.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Honestly, Mom, can you just leave?
We’re dealing with enough.
---
## MARY:
Oh, I’m sorry, I’ll disappear again.
---
## ANNE:
No—don’t, Mother.
It’s okay, stay.
Genevieve, I think I…
I think I might have prayed for her to come
---
## MARY:
Sweet Anne.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
What, Anne, how could you?
---
## MARY:
Shhh…
---
## ANNE:
It was almost an accident.
Because I thought…
I dunno because I thought…
Yeah, I dunno, I thought I was gonna die.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Okay, yeah, I might have thought that, too.
I might have prayed for her to come, too.
---
## MARY:
Sweet girls.
Oh, I got you rosaries.
Where are the…?
Where’d I put the…?
I got you each…
Where’s…?
I got the…
Shit.
---
## ISABEL:
Mom, go take a nap.
---
## MARY:
Isabel, are you dead yet?
---
## ANNE:
Lord, Mother!
Isabel, don’t listen to her.
---
## ISABEL:
No, it’s fine, I’m okay, bye, I have to take a nap.
---
## MARY:
Don’t take a nap.
---
## ISABEL:
I have to take a nap, I’m so tired.
---
## MARY:
Stay and talk to us.
---
## ISABEL:
I’ll talk tomorrow.
---
## MARY:
We came all the way here.
---
## ISABEL:
Well, *I* didn’t pray for that, goodnight.
---
## MARY:
Shhh let me help you.
---
## ISABEL:
No, you’re not actually a good helper, it’s not your
nature.
---
## MARY:
I know, but I’m here.
---
## ISABEL:
I know, but I’m tired.
---
## MARY:
Shhh.
Listen.
Okay, okay okay.
Shhh.
Okay.
Shhh.
We’re all on edge.
Here’s an idea.
Shhh.
As long as we’re very quiet: how about we all get drunk?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Good idea.
---
## ANNE:
Great.
---
## MARY:
Isabel?
---
## ISABEL:
Fine.
I’m drunk.
MOM.
Me too.
---
## ISABEL:
I’m trying not to sob from love for all of you.
---
## MARY:
Yes, shhh.
---
## ANNE:
Me too.
I feel really close to saying the perfect thing that will break this whole thing wide open.
---
## MARY:
Oh, shhh.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Me too.
So why can’t I be the one who has two bodies?
---
## MARY:
What, shhh?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Me and the other me.
One body gives a fuck, the other body doesn’t give a fuck.
One body making art while the second body runs around and has affairs with men with strong fifty-two year old bodies.
One body an art object, the other body an art monster.
Both bodies mothering, neither body othering.
Neither body mothering.
Neither body…

## MARY:
Shhh.
I’m drunk.
Your father and I have the perfect marriage.
We’ve been traveling around to fundraise for our Catholic vision.
We’ve been on the road for thirty years, going from conference to conference.
We see a way that the world can be and we’ve been showing people that world.
A tiny world…
A tiny world without end.
A tiny world without end that we keep in a box, want to see it?
Isn’t it beautiful?
Look, there you three are.
There was a real buzz around our tiny world without end.
People were buying in.
And we felt all this energy!
We had a second youth!
We were going to live forever and our tiny world was going to become the incarnate world, a new republic, an invisible empire of liberty and duty and form, a form in God’s image, a form that never disintegrates.
But things went a little wrong.
Somewhere along the way your father felt the dark wing wrap around him.
A dark wing wrapped around him and would not let go And now he’s sad.
And now he’s very sad.
And his sadness has its own body—its own very real shadow body—

## ISABEL:
Stop it, Mom, no, it doesn’t—
---
## MARY:
The other night I swore I could hear a third heartbeat there on the bed with us—
---
## ISABEL:
Jesus Christ.
---
## MARY:
What, Isabel?
---
## ISABEL:
You’re such a man coddler.
---
## MARY:
Shhh!
Stop being mean to me.
---
## ISABEL:
I’m not being mean to you, you’re so sensitive.
---
## MARY:
I don’t get why people call you nice, because you’re so mean to me.
---
## ISABEL:
Oh, okay, ya baby.
Ya big baby.
---
## ANNE:
Isabel, you’re being mean.
---
## ISABEL:
I am?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Yeah, you are.
Mom show us the tiny world again.
---
## MARY:
What—shhh.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
I want to see it, I want to see what you built, I want to see how you structured it

## MARY:
He said he loves you all very much.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
That’s not what he said.
---
## MARY:
Yes, it is, he thinks you’re all remarkable.
---
## ANNE:
Mom, tell us something remarkable about each of us.
---
## MARY:
Shhh, what’s that?
---
## ANNE:
We need it.
---
## MARY:
Something remarkable.
---
## ANNE:
Yes.
---
## MARY:
This isn’t like you, Anne.
---
## ANNE:
Who cares?
---
## MARY:
Shhh.
Does anyone need any hand lotion?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Yeah.
---
## ISABEL:
Okay.
---
## MARY:
On a Sunday, it’s good to use a little hand lotion.
It’s a smell that’s supposed to make you happy.
I stole this from a hotel in Philadelphia.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Oh my god, it smells so good.
---
## ISABEL:
It makes me happy.
---
## MARY:
Lavender.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Thanks Mom.
Can I see the tiny world, can I just look at it?
---
## MARY:
Did any of you to go to Mass today?
---
## ISABEL:
I did.
---
## MARY:
Thank you.
---
## ANNE:
Something remarkable, Mom.
---
## MARY:
Yes.
Okay.
Something remarkable.
About each of you.
In no particular order:
Isabel…
The way you, uh…
The way you, uh, danced!
The way you, uh, danced was so nice.
So special.
A little dancer flitting around the—
So, thank you for doing that.
And I’m sorry you got sick.
And stopped dancing.
And I’m sorry if you feel like I gave you an eating disorder.
With my comments.
But you were a beautiful dancer.
And…
But…
---
## ISABEL:
Okay, thanks.
---
## MARY:
And, okay, Genevieve.
I remember when you smashed the plate.
In anger.
You were so angry, we were having a political discussion and you disagreed.
And you threw the plate at the sink and it smashed.
Incredible.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Okay.
---
## MARY:
Okay, and Anne…
---
template: noise
Anne starts crying
Shhh.
Don’t cry, I’m trying to think of a good one.
---
## ANNE:
Uh-huh.
---
## MARY:
Because you’re the one who asked the question.
---
## ANNE:
Uh-huh
---
## MARY:
So obviously you need it the most!
So I want it to be good!
Okay…
---
## ANNE:
Okay…
---
## MARY:
Okay…
---

silence
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Jesus Christ.
---
## MARY:
What?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Just tell her anything nice, Mom, it’s not like ours were gorgeous gems.
---
## ISABEL:
Yeah, jeez, Mom, this is—
---
## MARY:
Shhhh I’m thinking.
Ahh
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Mom, what the heck?
---
## MARY:
What!
I didn’t want to say something obvious like “you’re smart.”
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Should we get drunk again?
---
## MARY:
Shhh, yes.
Anne, come back, we’re getting drunk.
---
## ANNE:
Okay.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Okay, we’re drunk again.
Oh, oh, oh!
I’m only saying this because I’m drunk.
---
## MARY:
Shhh.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
But I think the art I’m making is evil.
And anyone who likes it is evil, too.
---
## ISABEL:
I’m only saying this because I’m drunk, and I need y’all’s support on this, but I really do think I’m a saint, Mom.
God told me I’m a saint but we don’t have to talk about it.
---
## MARY:
I know, I’ve always known, shhh.
---
## ANNE:
I’m only saying this because I’m drunk, but I love Björk.
I really want to see Björk in concert.
I have sexual feelings for Björk.
I think my sexuality is Björk.
---
## MARY:
Shhh.
What is Björk?
---
## ANNE:
I’m drunk.
---
## MARY:
I’m only saying this because I’m drunk, but I don’t like the new pope.
He’s cheesy.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
I’m only saying this because I’m drunk, but I have a second Steve, Mom, okay?
---
## MARY:
A second Steve?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Yes, he split in two.
He’s a demon, he’s a ghost.
---
## ISABEL:
And, Mom, I’ve been haunted by a Faceless Ghost.
Actually, we’re cohabitating.
---
## MARY:
You’re living with someone?
You’re living in sin?
---
## ISABEL:
Yeah, with a ghost with no face.
MOM.
Does he love you?
---
## ANNE:
And, Mom, there are thousands of invisible Johns everywhere, I can hardly move through my home.
---
## ISABEL:
And, Mom, I just found out I can’t have babies
I have ovarian failure.
My estrogen and progesterone are so low.
I’ll never be a mother.
---
## MARY:
Oh, honey.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
I’m sorry, Isabel.
---
## ISABEL:
It’s okay, I’m a saint.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
And, Mom, tonight I found a third Steve.
A third Steve, making music in the garage.
He won’t leave.
And the other two Steves are really proud of him.
---
## ANNE:
And, Mom, at a certain point I stop knowing how to talk about myself, it becomes a pathology, I can only ask other people about themselves, and when they ask me about myself, I smile and deftly make it about them, I do this for the rest of my life until people don’t even think to ask me anymore until one day I forget my own name and I’m invisible even to my child, so I call you and you don’t answer, so I get in the car and start driving and while I’m on the road somewhere in Oklahoma, I suddenly see up ahead in a pool of light an enormous beast oozing—
---
## GENEVIEVE:
And, Mom, I’m trapped in Dallas, I’m trapped in Dallas forever, because of the divorce settlement I’m never allowed to leave, I’m never allowed to live in Iceland or run a museum in the Berkshires, I have to stay within a certain North Texas radius, and so I keep switching homes, I live in every possible vector of that radius, and one day I start to long for Plano, I pine for Plano, I move to Plano, I start selling real estate in Plano and grow my hair big and blonde and grow my boobs big and blonde and forget how to make art and when I tell you this your eyes flutter back fast flutter back fast flutter back and your tongue starts to turn into a red ribbon—
---
## ISABEL:
And, Mom, I love you but you locked me in a room with God, you said, “Here’s a God who loves you” but you didn’t tell me it might be a God who hates me, too, or ignores me, you made me fall in love with God and you didn’t tell me what to do once it started hurting all the time, and so one of the boys who loved me would do a thing to me, in the middle of the night this Christian boy who loved me would do a thing to me and I never consented to being a saint and sometimes I violate God, Mom, sometimes I do I violate, I violate, I carve things into the God who loves me and I don’t tell you until a panic attack when I’m forty-four and you’re very old and you start crying and the tears stay bunched up in front of your eyes like a windshield made of moving water—
---
## MARY:
And I had a mother too, believe it or not.
And I sat at her feet too, believe it or not, and asked her if the world was ending.
And it never was, and it always was.
Oh, somewhere, my mother.
My mother.
She’s sitting on the Duncan Phyfe, waiting for him.
Dressing up for him.
Somewhere I’m little and there’s a Chinese jacket and cocktails and small shoes with thin ankle-length black silk pants.
I wear them, like Mother, for Father, and think about two-inch heels and little diamond earrings, and stay with Mother on the couch with her legs, try to make her legs shine, try to help her smell like better sex than the sex on his breath, and if it isn’t sex on the breath then it’s just the breath itself, always exhaling, grumpy and fogging up the good China, and then he’s gone again, so sit there all night, for another thirty years.
Remember everything you can about the steel inside her veins.
Remember everything you can about her.
And I would work on my tiny world and say, “*Why are you waiting*?” and she would say, “*For your father*” and I, “*Why*?” and she, “*Why not*?” and I, “*My father you’re waiting for my father my father but you’re my mother my mother and—*” I can’t be like this so I’m cutting loose yes I’ll change the world and I’ll work forever and I’ll sleep through the night and I’ll never marry and I’ll never…

Oh, no, we’ve been too loud, we’ve woken them up.
Oh, no.
Say your prayers.

What?

## ANNE:
Who’s in there?

## GENEVIEVE:
Who’s in there, Mom?

They follow us around.

Oh, they’re coming out now.
They’ve been out all day and they might be grumpy
boys.
Just stay very quiet and those grumpy boys might go to bed.

Just stay very still.
Just keep building your tiny world, honey.
You can show it to him in the morning.

---
## MARY:
Your poor fevers…
---
## MARY:
Anne, I have your remarkable thing.
Do you remember the red ribbon?
I was raging around the house like Greek tragedy.
I had a fever.
I wanted to murder the children of my husband.
When I was young, I can’t tell you how excited I was for eternal love with this tall man.
And then it was just gone.
He was gone, he was with someone else.
You were all playing in the other room.
And I was going to walk in there and smother you all to death.
But you were all looking at the staircase.
The red ribbon, going down, step by step, with a mind of its own.
We watched it go all the way down.
And Anne, you grabbed it and burned it in the backyard.
---
## ANNE:
No, that was you.
You burned it.
---
## MARY:
No, it was you.
You’ve always protected us.
And then Genevieve you made us dinner.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
No.
---
## MARY:
Yes.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
What did I make?
---
## MARY:
Grilled cheese.
You were eight.
Where did you all come from?
I wasn’t ready for the mystery of beautiful daughters.
I thought I could shape it—I thought I could shape you.
But there’s no shaping it.
And then it gets away from you.
And what can I say—it’s a nightmare for me, too, showing up a monster to you, can you *imagine*…
Well, I’ll tell you I love you later, it’s later, and we drive around in the Subaru and leave you voicemails on the Bluetooth and call us back, okay, let us hear from you.
---
## ANNE:
Why are we here still?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Where?
---
## ANNE:
On this porch.
You sold this house.
---
## ISABEL:
Yeah, you don’t live here anymore.
Can we leave?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
We’ll leave later.
---
## ANNE:
It’s later.
Why are we here still?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Jesus Christ, I don’t know.
I don’t know how to know anything.
How do you love the place you are?
---
## ANNE:
I’m hungry.
---
## ISABEL:
Me too.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
I’m so hungry.
---
## ANNE:
Should we go to Bolsa Mercado?
---
## ISABEL:
What’s Bolsa Mercado?
---
## ANNE:
The new market, it’s great.
---
## ISABEL:
Is it great?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
It went out of business.
---
## ANNE:
No, it didn’t, it just opened.
---
## ISABEL:
Let’s go!
---
## GENEVIEVE:
No.
It’s been closed for three and a half years.
---
## ANNE:
Oh, weird.
I thought that things proceeded through time.
But I guess they don’t.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Can we not talk about it?
---
## ANNE:
I think everything happens all at once.
All at once in a random hell.
---
## ISABEL:
It’s a fucking hole in my head all the time.
---
## ANNE:
All at once at the noisy center of the scariest feeling you’ve ever had.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Fuck!
---
## ANNE:
What?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
I wanted to steal the tiny world but I forgot.
---
## ANNE:
Damn.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Did you see us?
In her tiny world, did you see us?
---
## ANNE:
I couldn’t see us.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Me neither.
---
## ISABEL:
I saw us.
---
## ANNE:
You did?
---
## ISABEL:
I stole it.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
You did?
Where are we?
---
## ISABEL:
We’re here.
Do you see us?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Yeah.
---
## ANNE:
Okay, yeah.
---
## GENEVIEVE:
I don’t like it—ugh, ew, I don’t like it.
---
## ISABEL:
Oh, I kinda like it.
You don’t like it?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
No, ugh, ew, what are we *doing* in there?
---
## ISABEL:
I don’t know.
I don’t know what we’re doing.
We’re just in there.
We’re a tiny part of a tiny thing that never ends.
---
## ANNE:
Oh, weird.
Y’all I have something to tell you.
Isabel are you okay?
---
## ISABEL:
Am I okay?
---
## ANNE:
You get okay, right?
---
## ISABEL:
Yeah, I get okay.
What’d you want to tell us?
---
## ANNE:
I’ll tell you later.
And Genevieve you get okay?
---
## GENEVIEVE:
Yeah, yeah I get okay, too.
What were you gonna say Anne?
---
## ANNE:
Oh, well, it’s actually kind of good news, actually not really, I mean it’s just *different*, I mean whatever, I feel all this pressure to declare a transformation, but I’m so tired, honestly it feels like one thing too many, doing the labor of declaring my transformation, which *is* here, which I *do* feel, I’m just fucking exhausted—
---
## ISABEL:
What is it?
---
## ANNE:
Oh, I’ll tell you later.
It’s later.
Oh, Lord.
Fuck.
Okay.
