## RODERIGO:
Awake, what ho, Brabantio!
--

## IAGO:
Thieves, thieves!

---
## &nbsp;
Look to your house, your daughter!
---

## BRABANTIO:
What is the matter there?

---
## IAGO:
Zounds, sir, you are robbed!
---
## &nbsp;
Your heart is burst, you
have lost half your soul.
---
## RODERIGO:
Most reverend signior,
do you know my voice?
---
## BRABANTIO:
What art thou?
---
## RODERIGO:
My name is Roderigo.
---
## BRABANTIO:
God, the worser welcome!
---
## &nbsp;
I have told thee, my
daughter is not for thee.
---
## IAGO:
I am one, sir, that comes
to tell you your daughter
---
## &nbsp;
and the Moor are now making
the beast with two backs.
---
## BRABANTIO:
Thou art a villain!
---
## IAGO:
You are a senator!
---
## RODERIGO:
Sir, your fair daughter has been taken
---
## &nbsp;
into the gross clasps
of a lascivious Moor.
---
## BRABANTIO:
This incident is not unlike my dream.
---
## &nbsp;
Light, I say, light!
---
## &nbsp;
It is too true an evil,
---
## &nbsp;
gone she is.
---
## &nbsp;
O’, unhappy girl with
the Moor, say’st thou?
---
## &nbsp;
Who would be a father?
---
## &nbsp;
Are they married, think you?
---
## RODERIGO:
Truly I think they are.
---
## BRABANTIO:
O’, she deceives, she deceives,
---
## &nbsp;
she deceives.
---
## &nbsp;
Would you have had her!
---
## &nbsp;
O’, thou foul thief.
---
## &nbsp;
Where hast thou stowed my daughter?
---
## &nbsp;
Damned as thou art,
thou hast enchanted her
---
## &nbsp;
with drugs that weakens motion,
---
## &nbsp;
for I’ll refer me to all things of sense.
---
## &nbsp;
If she in chains of magic were not bound,
---
## &nbsp;
whether a maid so happy,
---
## &nbsp;
would ever have t’incur a general mock,
---
## &nbsp;
run from her guardian to the sooty bosom
---
## &nbsp;
of such a thing as thou?
---
## &nbsp;
I, therefore, apprehend thee
for an abuser of the world!
---
## &nbsp;
If you do resist, I shall
subdue you at your peril!
---
## OTHELLO:
Hold your hands.
---
## &nbsp;
Were it my cue to fight,
---
## &nbsp;
I should have known it without a prompter.
---
## &nbsp;
Lieutenant.
---
## DUKE:
“Sultan of the Turks
to the Duke of Venice:
---
## &nbsp;
We demand of you Cyprus,
which you will give willingly,
---
## &nbsp;
or we shall wage most cruel
war against you everywhere.”
---
## &nbsp;
’Tis certain then for Cyprus.
---
## &nbsp;
Valiant Othello, we must straight employ
---
## &nbsp;
you against the general enemy Turks.
---
## &nbsp;
I did not see you.
---
## &nbsp;
We lacked your counsel
and your help tonight.
---
## BRABANTIO:
My daughter, O’ my daughter!
--

## DUKE:
Dead?
---
## BRABANTIO:
Aye, to me she is abused,
---
## &nbsp;
stolen from me and corrupted by spells
---
## &nbsp;
and medicines bought of mountebanks.
---
## DUKE:
Whoe’er he be, that
in this foul proceeding
---
## &nbsp;
hath thus beguiled your
daughter of herself
---
## &nbsp;
and you of her, the bloody book of law
---
## &nbsp;
you shall yourself read,
---
## &nbsp;
though our proper son
stood in your action.
---
## BRABANTIO:
I humbly thank your Grace.
---
## &nbsp;
Here is the man, this Moor.
---
## DUKE:
We are very sorry for it.
---
## &nbsp;
What in your own part can you say to this?
---
## BRABANTIO:
Nothing, but this is so.
---
## OTHELLO:
Most potent, grave, and reverend Duke.
---
## &nbsp;
Signiors, that I have ta’en
away this old man’s daughter,
---
## &nbsp;
it is most true; true, I have married her.
---
## &nbsp;
Rude am I in my speech and
little blest with the soft phrase
---
## &nbsp;
of peace, for since these
arms of mine had seven years
---
## &nbsp;
since now some nine months wasted,
---
## &nbsp;
they have used their dearest
action in the tented ﬁeld,
---
## &nbsp;
and little of this great
world can I speak more
---
## &nbsp;
than pertains to feats
of broil and battle,
---
## &nbsp;
and, therefore, little
shall I grace my cause
---
## &nbsp;
in speaking for myself.
---
## &nbsp;
Yet, by your Grace’s patience,
---
## &nbsp;
I will a round unvarnished tale deliver
---
## &nbsp;
of my whole course of love,
what drugs, what charms,
---
## &nbsp;
what conjuration and what mighty magic
---
## &nbsp;
for such proceeding I am charged
withal, I won his daughter.
---
## BRABANTIO:
She, in spite of nature,
---
## &nbsp;
of years, of country, credit, everything,
---
## &nbsp;
to fall in love with what
she feared to look on?
---
## DUKE:
Othello, speak.
---
## &nbsp;
Did you by indirect and
forced courses subdue
---
## &nbsp;
and poison this young maid’s affections?
---
## &nbsp;
Or came it by request
and such fair question
---
## &nbsp;
as soul to soul affordeth?
---
## OTHELLO:
I do beseech you.
---
## &nbsp;
Send for the lady,
---
## &nbsp;
and let her speak of me before her father.
---
## &nbsp;
If you do find me foul in her report,
---
## &nbsp;
the trust, the office I do
hold of you not only take away,
---
## &nbsp;
but let your sentence
even fall upon my life.
---
## DUKE:
Fetch Desdemona hither.
---
## OTHELLO:
And till she come,
---
## &nbsp;
so justly to your grave ears, I’ll present
---
## &nbsp;
how I did thrive in this fair lady’s love
---
## &nbsp;
and she in mine.
---
## DUKE:
Say it, Othello.
---
## OTHELLO:
Her father loved me, oft invited me,
---
## &nbsp;
still questioned me the story
of my life from year to year,
---
## &nbsp;
the battles, sieges,
fortunes I have passed.
---
## &nbsp;
Wherein I spake of most
disastrous chances,
---
## &nbsp;
of moving accidents by flood and ﬁeld,
---
## &nbsp;
of hair-breadth scapes in
the imminent deadly breach,
---
## &nbsp;
of being taken by the insolent foe
---
## &nbsp;
and sold to slavery;
of my redemption thence
---
## &nbsp;
and with it, all my travel’s
history wherein of caverns vast
---
## &nbsp;
and deserts idle, rough
quarries, rocks and hills
---
## &nbsp;
whose heads touch heaven.
---
## &nbsp;
It was my hint to speak,
such was my process,
---
## &nbsp;
and of the cannibals that each
other eat the Anthropophagi,
---
## &nbsp;
and men whose heads do grow
beneath their shoulders.
---
## &nbsp;
This to hear,
---
## &nbsp;
would Desdemona seriously incline,
---
## &nbsp;
and with a greedy ear
devour up my discourse;
---
## &nbsp;
which I, observing,
took once a pliant hour
---
## &nbsp;
and found good means to
draw from her a prayer
---
## &nbsp;
of earnest heart that I would
all my pilgrimage dilate.
---
## &nbsp;
I did consent.
---
## &nbsp;
I ran it through, even from my boyish days
---
## &nbsp;
to the very moment that
she bade me tell it,
---
## &nbsp;
and often did beguile her of her tears
---
## &nbsp;
when I did speak of
some distressful stroke
---
## &nbsp;
that my youth suffered.
---
## &nbsp;
My story being done,
she gave me for my pains
---
## &nbsp;
a world of sighs.
---
## &nbsp;
She swore in faith ’twas
strange, ’twas passing strange,
---
## &nbsp;
’twas pitiful, ’twas wondrous pitiful.
---
## &nbsp;
She wished she had not heard it
---
## &nbsp;
and yet, she wished heaven
had made her such a man.
---
## &nbsp;
She thanked me and bade me if
I had a friend that loved her,
---
## &nbsp;
I should but teach him
how to tell my story
---
## &nbsp;
and that would woo her.
---
## &nbsp;
Upon this hint I spake.
---
## &nbsp;
She loved me for the dangers I had passed.
---
## &nbsp;
And I loved her that she did pity them.
---
## &nbsp;
This only is the witchcraft I have used.
---
## DUKE:
I think this tale would
win my daughter too.
---
## &nbsp;
Good Brabantio, take up this
mangled matter at the best.
---
## &nbsp;
Men do their broken weapons rather use
---
## &nbsp;
than their bare hands.
---
## BRABANTIO:
I pray you, hear her speak.
---
## &nbsp;
If she confess that
she was half the wooer,
---
## &nbsp;
destruction on my head if my
bad blame light on the man.
---
## &nbsp;
Come hither, gentle mistress.
---
## &nbsp;
Do you perceive, in
all this noble company,
---
## &nbsp;
where most you owe obedience?
---
## DESDEMONA:
My noble father,
---
## &nbsp;
I do perceive here a divided duty.
---
## &nbsp;
To you, I am bound for life and education.
---
## &nbsp;
My life and education both do learn me
---
## &nbsp;
how to respect you.
---
## &nbsp;
You are the lord of duty,
---
## &nbsp;
I am hitherto your daughter.
---
## &nbsp;
But here is my husband.
---
## &nbsp;
And so much duty as my
mother showed to you,
---
## &nbsp;
preferring you before her father,
---
## &nbsp;
so much I challenge, I may
profess due to the Moor, my lord.
---
## BRABANTIO:
God be with you, I have done.
---
## &nbsp;
Please it you Grace, on
to the state affairs;
---
## &nbsp;
I’d rather to adopt a child than beget it.
---
## &nbsp;
Come hither, Moor.
---
## &nbsp;
I here do give thee that with all my heart
---
## &nbsp;
which, but thou hast already,
---
## &nbsp;
with all my heart I would keep from thee.
---
## &nbsp;
For your sake, jewel,
---
## &nbsp;
I am glad at soul I have no other child.
---
## DUKE:
Let me speak like
yourself, and lay a sentence
---
## &nbsp;
which as a step, may help
these lovers into your favor.
---
## &nbsp;
When remedies are past
the griefs are ended
---
## &nbsp;
by seeing the worst which
late on hopes depended.
---
## &nbsp;
To mourn a mischief that’s past and gone
---
## &nbsp;
is the next way to draw new mischief on.
---
## &nbsp;
The robbed that smiles steals
something from the thief,
---
## &nbsp;
he robs himself that
spends a bootless grief.
---
## BRABANTIO:
Then let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile,
---
## &nbsp;
we lose it not, so long as we can smile.
---
## &nbsp;
He bears the sentence
well that nothing bears
---
## &nbsp;
but the free comfort which
from thence he hears.
---
## &nbsp;
But he bears both the
sentence and the sorrow
---
## &nbsp;
that, to pay grief, must
of poor patience borrow.
---
## &nbsp;
But words are words: I never yet did hear
---
## &nbsp;
the bruised heart was
pierced through the ear.
---
## &nbsp;
I humbly beseech your Grace,
on to the state affairs.
---
## DUKE:
The Turk with a most mighty
preparation makes for Cyprus.
---
## &nbsp;
Othello, the fortitude of the
place is best known to you,
---
## &nbsp;
and, though we have there a substitute
---
## &nbsp;
of most allowed sufficiency,
one worthy Montano,
---
## &nbsp;
yet opinion, a sovereign
mistress of effects,
---
## &nbsp;
throws a more safer voice on you.
---
## &nbsp;
You must, therefore, be
content to slubber the gloss
---
## &nbsp;
of your new fortunes
with this more stubborn
---
## &nbsp;
and boisterous expedition.
---
## &nbsp;
The affair cries haste
and speed must answer it.
---
## OTHELLO:
The tyrant custom, hath made the flinty
---
## &nbsp;
and steel couch of war my
thrice-driven bed of down.
---
## &nbsp;
I do undertake this
present war with the Turks.
---
## &nbsp;
Most humbly therefore,
bending to your state,
---
## &nbsp;
I crave accommodations for my wife,
---
## &nbsp;
as levels with her breeding.
---
## DUKE:
Why, at her father’s.
---
## BRABANTIO:
I’ll not have it so!
---
## OTHELLO:
Nor I.
--

## DESDEMONA:
Nor I.
---
## &nbsp;
I would not there reside to put my father
---
## &nbsp;
in impatient thoughts by being in his eye.
---
## &nbsp;
Most gracious Duke,
---
## &nbsp;
that I did love the Moor to live with him,
---
## &nbsp;
my downright violence
and storm of fortunes
---
## &nbsp;
may trumpet to the world.
---
## &nbsp;
My heart’s subdued, even to
the very quality of my lord.
---
## &nbsp;
I saw Othello’s visage in his mind,
---
## &nbsp;
and to his honors and his valiant parts
---
## &nbsp;
did I my soul and fortunes consecrate,
---
## &nbsp;
so that, dear lords, if I be left behind,
---
## &nbsp;
a moth of peace, and he go to the war,
---
## &nbsp;
the rites for which I
love him are bereft me,
---
## &nbsp;
and I, a heavy interim, shall
support by his dear absence.
---
## &nbsp;
Let me go with him.
---
## OTHELLO:
Let her have your voice.
---
## &nbsp;
The vouch with me, heaven,
I therefore beg it not
---
## &nbsp;
to please the palate of my appetite,
---
## &nbsp;
nor to comply with heat
and proper satisfaction,
---
## &nbsp;
but to be free and bounteous to her mind.
---
## &nbsp;
And heaven defend your
good souls that you think
---
## &nbsp;
I will your serious and
great business scant
---
## &nbsp;
when she is with me.
---
## DUKE:
Be it as you shall privately determine,
---
## &nbsp;
either for her stay or
going, you must away tonight.
---
## DESDEMONA:
Tonight, my lord?
---
## DUKE:
This night.
---
## OTHELLO:
With all my heart.
---
## DUKE:
Good night to everyone.
---
## &nbsp;
And, noble signior,
---
## &nbsp;
if virtue no delighted beauty lack,
---
## &nbsp;
your son-in-law is far
more fair than black.
---
## &nbsp;
Adieu, brave Moor.
---
## &nbsp;
Use Desdemona well.
---
## BRABANTIO:
Look to her, Moor, if
thou hast eyes to see.
---
## &nbsp;
She has deceived her father, and may thee.
---
## OTHELLO:
My life upon her faith.
---
## &nbsp;
Honest Iago, my Desdemona
must I leave to thee.
---
## &nbsp;
I prithee, let thy wife Emilia
---
## &nbsp;
attend on her laughs
---
## &nbsp;
and bring them after
in the best advantage.
---
## &nbsp;
Come, Desdemona, I have
but an hour of love,
---
## &nbsp;
of worldly pattern and
direction to spend with you.
---
## &nbsp;
We must obey the time.
---
## RODERIGO:
Iago!
---
## IAGO:
What sayst thou, noble heart?
---
## RODERIGO:
I take it much unkindly
---
## &nbsp;
that thou, Iago, who hast had my purse
---
## &nbsp;
as if the strings were
thine, shouldst know of this.
---
## &nbsp;
What will I do, think’st thou?
---
## IAGO:
Why, go to bed and sleep.
---
## RODERIGO:
I will
incontinently drown myself.
---
## IAGO:
Why, thou silly gentleman?
---
## RODERIGO:
It is silliness to live
when to live is torment?
---
## IAGO:
O’, villainous!
---
## &nbsp;
I have looked upon the world
for four times, eleven years,
---
## &nbsp;
and never found a man that
knew how to love himself.
---
## RODERIGO:
What will I do?
---
## &nbsp;
I admit it is my shame to be so fond,
---
## &nbsp;
but it is not within
my virtue to amend it.
---
## IAGO:
Virtue?
---
## &nbsp;
A fig!
---
## &nbsp;
’tis in ourselves that
we are thus, or thus.
---
## &nbsp;
We have reason to cool our raging motions,
---
## &nbsp;
our carnal stings, our unbitted lusts.
---
## &nbsp;
Love is merely a lust of the blood
---
## &nbsp;
and a permission of the will.
---
## &nbsp;
Come, be a man!
---
## &nbsp;
Drown thyself?
---
## &nbsp;
Drown cats and blind puppies.
---
## &nbsp;
Put money in thy purse,
---
## &nbsp;
follow thou the wars, I
say, put money in thy purse.
---
## &nbsp;
It cannot be that Desdemona
should long continue her love
---
## &nbsp;
to the Moor, nor he him to her.
---
## &nbsp;
When she is sated with his body,
---
## &nbsp;
she will find the error of her choice.
---
## &nbsp;
She must have change, she must.
---
## &nbsp;
Therefore, put money in thy purse.
---
## &nbsp;
A pox of drowning thyself,
it is clean out of the way.
---
## &nbsp;
Seek thou rather to be hanged
---
## &nbsp;
in compassing thy joy than to be drowned
---
## &nbsp;
and go without her.
---
## RODERIGO:
Wilt thou be fast to my hopes?
---
## IAGO:
Thou art sure of me.
Go, provide thy money.
---
## &nbsp;
We will have more of this anon.
---
## RODERIGO:
I’ll be with thee betimes.
---
## IAGO:
Go to, farewell.
---
## &nbsp;
Do you hear, Roderigo?
---
## RODERIGO:
What say you?
---
## IAGO:
No more of drowning, do you hear?
---
## RODERIGO:
Oh, no, I am changed.
---
## &nbsp;
I’ll sell all my land.
---
---
## IAGO:
I hate the Moor.
---
## &nbsp;
And it is thought abroad
that ‘twixt my sheets,
---
## &nbsp;
he hath done my office.
---
## &nbsp;
I know not if it be true,
---
## &nbsp;
but I for mere suspicion in that kind
---
## &nbsp;
will do as if for surety.

O’, my sweet,

Come, my dear love, the purchase made,

Mark me with what violence
she first loved the Moor,

when the blood is made
dull with the act of sport,

there should be, again, to inflame it,

sympathy in years, manners, beauties,

## &nbsp;
all which Othello is
defective in very nature

will compel her to some second choice.

## &nbsp;
Now sir, this granted.

## &nbsp;
Who stands so eminent in
the degree of this fortune
---
## &nbsp;
as Cassio does?
---
## &nbsp;
And the woman hath found him already.

No, I cannot believe that of her,

she’s full of most blest conditions.

Blest fig’s-end!

The wine she drinks is made of grapes.

Now sir, be you ruled by me,

I brought you from Venice.

Do you find some occasion to anger Cassio?

Well.

Sir, he’s rash.

And very sudden in temper,
and haply may strike at you.

Provoke him that he may,

The Moor, howbeit I endure him not,

is of a constant loving, noble nature,

and I dare think he’ll prove to Desdemona,

a most dear husband.

Now, I do love her too.

Not out of absolute lust,

hath leaped into my seat,

Desdemona.

I felt alone in Venice for a while.

## &nbsp;
But when I met you,

## &nbsp;
I discovered that love doesn’t see color.
---
## &nbsp;
For the first time I realized
---
## &nbsp;
that love was not just a pretty idea.
---
## &nbsp;
Or something that happens to
other people, like, death.
---
## &nbsp;
Because of you, I realized
that love is possible for me.
---
## &nbsp;
Because of my love for
you, the world changed
---
## &nbsp;
when I fell in love and it’ll
never be the same (laughs)
---
## &nbsp;
because of my love for you,
I’m startin’ to see all of you.
---
## &nbsp;
My worthy friends, my
brothers, in new ways.
---
## &nbsp;
Because of my love, I
somehow feel both stronger
---
## &nbsp;
and more vulnerable.
---
## &nbsp;
I feel both free and caught.
---
## &nbsp;
Free, because now,
because of you, Desdemona,
---

## &nbsp;
I have a home: your embrace.

---

## &nbsp;
And caught, because I feel
the glory and suffering

---

## &nbsp;
of the world so much more vividly now

---
## &nbsp;
than I ever could have imagined.
---
## &nbsp;
Desdemona, my soul’s joy,
---
## &nbsp;
that gives me wonder great as my content
---
## &nbsp;
to see you here before me.

I cannot speak enough of this content.

Zounds, if I once stir,

Give me to know how this foul rout began,

who set it on? ’Tis monstrous.
---

On thy love, Iago, who began’t?

## IAGO:
Thus it is, general:
---
## &nbsp;
I found them close together

## &nbsp;
at blow and thrust, even as again
---
## &nbsp;
they were when you yourself did part them.
---

But, men are men, the
best sometimes forget.

Yes, surely Cassio, I believe,

## &nbsp;
received from one that fled
some strange indignity.
---

Cassio,
---
## &nbsp;
I do love thee,

## &nbsp;
but never more be officer of mine.
---
## DESDEMONA:
What’s the matter, dear?

I’ll make thee an example.

All’s well now, sweetie.

Come away to bed.

Sir, for your hurts, myself
will be your surgeon.

to have their balmy
slumbers waked with strife.

O’, I’ve lost my reputation,

I’ve lost the immortal part of myself

## &nbsp;
and what remains is bestial.

My reputation, Iago, my reputation!

## IAGO:
What, man,
---
## &nbsp;
there are ways to recover
the general again.
---
## &nbsp;
You are but now cast in his mood,
---
## &nbsp;
a punishment more in
policy than in malice.
---
## &nbsp;
Sue to him again, and he’s yours.
---
## CASSIO:
I would rather sue to be despised,
---
## &nbsp;
than to deceive so good a
commander with so slight,
---
## &nbsp;
so drunken, so indiscreet an officer.
---
## &nbsp;
Drunk?
---
## IAGO:
What was he that angered
you? What had he done to you?
---
## CASSIO:
I know not.
---
## IAGO:
Is’t possible?
---
## CASSIO:
I remember a mass of things,
but nothing distinctly;
---
## &nbsp;
a quarrel, but nothing wherefore, O’ God,
---
## &nbsp;
that men should put an
enemy in their mouths,
---
## &nbsp;
to make them steal away their brains!

To be now a sensible
man, by and by a fool,
---
## &nbsp;
and presently a beast!
---
## &nbsp;
One unperfectness shows me another,
---
## &nbsp;
to make me frankly despise myself.
---
## IAGO:
Come, you are too severe a moraler.
---
## CASSIO:
I will go ask for my place again,

## &nbsp;
he shall tell me I am a drunkard.

Confess yourself freely to her,

---
## OTHELLO:
Indeed? Ay, indeed.
---
## &nbsp;
Discern’st thou aught in that?
---
## &nbsp;
Is he not honest?
---
## IAGO:
Honest, my lord?
---
## OTHELLO:
Honest? Ay, honest.
---
## IAGO:
My lord, for aught I know.
---
## OTHELLO:
What dost thou think?
---
## IAGO:
Think, my lord?
---
## OTHELLO:
“Think, my lord!”
---
## &nbsp;
By heaven, thou echo’st me
---
## &nbsp;
as if there were some monster
---
## &nbsp;
in thy thought too hideous to be shown.
---
## &nbsp;
Thou dost mean something.
---
## &nbsp;
If thou dost love me, show me thy thought.
---
## IAGO:
My lord, you know I love you.
---
## OTHELLO:
I think thou dost.
---
## &nbsp;
And for I know thou’rt
full of love and honesty
---
## &nbsp;
and weigh’st thy words before
thou giv’st them thought,
---
## &nbsp;
therefore, these stops of
thine fright me the more.
---
## IAGO:
For Michael Cassio,
---
## &nbsp;
I dare be sworn, I
think, that he is honest.
---
## OTHELLO:
I think so too.
---
## IAGO:
Men should be what they seem,
---
## &nbsp;
and those that be not,
would they might seem none.
---
## OTHELLO:
Certain, men should be what they seem.
---
## IAGO:
Why then, I think
Cassio’s an honest man.
---
## OTHELLO:
Nay, yet there’s more in this:
---
## &nbsp;
I prithee speak to me,
as to thy thinkings,
---
## &nbsp;
as thou dost ruminate, and
give thy worst of thoughts
---
## &nbsp;
the worst of words.
---
## IAGO:
Good my lord, pardon
me; utter my thoughts?
---
## OTHELLO:
Thou dost conspire
against thy friend, Iago,
---
## &nbsp;
if thou but think’st him
wronged and mak’st his ear
---
## &nbsp;
a stranger to thy thoughts.
---
## IAGO:
I do beseech you,
---
## &nbsp;
though I perchance am vicious in my guess,
---
## &nbsp;
as I confess, it is my nature’s plague
---
## &nbsp;
to spy into abuses, and oft
my jealousy, shapes, faults
---
## &nbsp;
that are not.
---
## &nbsp;
I entreat you then.
---
## &nbsp;
It were not for your quiet, nor your good,
---
## &nbsp;
nor for my manhood, honesty, and wisdom
---
## &nbsp;
to let you know my thoughts.
---
## OTHELLO:
Zounds! What dost thou mean?
---
## IAGO:
Good name in man and
woman, dear my lord,
---
## &nbsp;
is the immediate jewel of their soul:
---
## &nbsp;
who steals my purse, steals trash.
---
## &nbsp;
’tis something, ’tis nothing,
---
## &nbsp;
’twas mine, ’tis his, and
has been slave to thousands.
---
## &nbsp;
But, he that filches from me my good name,
---
## &nbsp;
robs me of that which not enriches him
---
## &nbsp;
and makes me poor indeed.
---
## OTHELLO:
By heaven, I’ll know thy thoughts!
---
## IAGO:
You cannot, if my
heart were in your hand,
---
## &nbsp;
nor shall not whilst ’tis in my custody.
---
template: noise
Othello laughs
---
## IAGO:
O’ beware, my lord, of jealousy!
---
## &nbsp;
It is the green-eyed monster,
---
## &nbsp;
which doth mock the meat it feeds on.
---
## OTHELLO:
Why?
---
## &nbsp;
Why is this?
---
## &nbsp;
Think’st thou I’d make a life of jealousy
---
## &nbsp;
to follow still the changes of the moon
---
## &nbsp;
with fresh suspicions? No!
---
## &nbsp;
To be once in doubt is
once to be resolved.
---
## &nbsp;
’Tis not to make me jealous
---
## &nbsp;
to say my wife is fair, is free of speech,
---
## &nbsp;
loves company,
---
## &nbsp;
nor from mine own weak merits will I draw
---
## &nbsp;
the smallest fear, nor
doubt of her revolt,
---
## &nbsp;
for she had eyes and chose me. (laughs)
---
## &nbsp;
No, Iago, I’ll see before I doubt,
---
## &nbsp;
when I doubt, prove,
---
## &nbsp;
and upon the proof,
there’s no more but this:
---
## &nbsp;
away at once with love or jealousy!
---
## IAGO:
I am glad of this, for
now, I shall have reason
---
## &nbsp;
to show the love and duty that I bear you
---
## &nbsp;
with franker spirit:
therefore, as I am bound,
---
## &nbsp;
receive it from me.
---
## &nbsp;
I speak not yet of proof:
---
## &nbsp;
look to your wife, observe
her well with Cassio.
---
template: noise
Othello laughs
---
## &nbsp;
Wear your eyes thus,
not jealous nor secure;
---
## &nbsp;
I would not have your
free and noble nature out
---
## &nbsp;
of self-bounty be abused: look to’t.
---
## &nbsp;
I do know our country disposition well.
---
## &nbsp;
In Venice they do let God see the pranks
---
## &nbsp;
they dare not show their husbands;
---
## &nbsp;
their best conscience is
not to leave’t undone,
---
## &nbsp;
but keep’t unknown.
---
## OTHELLO:
Dost thou say so?
---
## IAGO:
She did deceive her
father, marrying you,
---
## &nbsp;
and when she seemed to
shake, and fear your looks,
---
## &nbsp;
she loved them most.
---
## OTHELLO:
And so she did.
---
## IAGO:
Why, go to then?
---
template: noise
Othello laughs
---
## IAGO:
But I am much to blame,
---
## &nbsp;
and humbly do beseech you of your pardon
---
## &nbsp;
for too much loving you.
---
## OTHELLO:
I am bound to thee forever.
---
## IAGO:
I see this hath a little
dashed your spirits.
---
## OTHELLO:
Not a jot, not a jot.
---
## IAGO:
I’faith, I fear it has.
---
## &nbsp;
I hope you will consider what
is spoke comes from my love.
---
## &nbsp;
But I do see you’re moved;
---
## &nbsp;
I am to pray you not to strain my speech
---
## &nbsp;
to grosser issues, nor to larger reach
---
## &nbsp;
than to suspicion.
---
## OTHELLO:
I will not.
--

## IAGO:
Should you do so, my lord,
---
## IAGO:
my speech should fall in such vile success
---
## &nbsp;
as my thoughts aimed not at:
Cassio’s my worthy friend.
---
## &nbsp;
My lord, I see you’re moved.
---
## OTHELLO:
No, not much moved.
---
## &nbsp;
I do not think but Desdemona’s honest.
---
## IAGO:
Long live she so; and
long live you think so.
---
## OTHELLO:
And yet, how nature,
erring from itself...
---
## IAGO:
Ay, there’s the point:
---
## &nbsp;
as, to be bold with you,
---
## &nbsp;
not to enter into any
marriage of her own clime,
---
## &nbsp;
complexion, and degree,
---
## &nbsp;
I fear her will,
---
## &nbsp;
recoiling to her better judgement,
---
## &nbsp;
may fall to match you
with her country forms,
---
## &nbsp;
and happily repent.
---
## OTHELLO:
Farewell, farewell.
---
## &nbsp;
If more thou dost
perceive, let me know more:
---
## &nbsp;
set on thy wife to observe.
---
## &nbsp;
Leave me, Iago.

My lord, I take my leave.

O’ curse of marriage

that we can call these
delicate creatures ours

and not their appetites!

Look where she comes:

if she be false, by then,

I’ll not believe’t.

How now, my dear Othello?

I do attend your presence.

I am to blame.

Why do you speak so faintly?

Are you not well?

Come, I’ll go in with you.

I am very sorry you are not well.

To have a foolish wife.

O’, is that all?

What will you give me now
for that same handkerchief?
---
## IAGO:
What handkerchief?
--

## EMILIA:
What handkerchief?
---
## EMILIA:
Why, that the Moor
first gave to Desdemona,
---
## &nbsp;
that which so often you did bid me steal.
---
## IAGO:
Hast stolen it from her?
---
## EMILIA:
No, faith, she let
it drop by negligence.
---
## &nbsp;
What will you do with’t,
that you have been so earnest
---
## &nbsp;
to have me filch it?
---
## IAGO:
Why, what’s that to you?
---
## EMILIA:
If it be not for some purpose
of import, give’t me again.
---
---
## IAGO:
This may do something.
---
---
## OTHELLO:
(laughs)
False to me?
---
## IAGO:
How now, general? No more of that.
---
## OTHELLO:
Avaunt, be gone, thou
hast set me on the rack!
---
## &nbsp;
I swear ’tis better to be much abused
---
## &nbsp;
than but to know’t a little.
---
## IAGO:
How now, my lord?
---
## OTHELLO:
What sense had I of
her stolen hours of lust?
---
## &nbsp;
I saw’t not, thought it
not, it harmed not me,
---
## &nbsp;
I slept the next night well,
fed well, was free and merry;
---
## &nbsp;
I found not Cassio’s kisses on her lips.
---
## IAGO:
I am sorry to hear this.
---
## OTHELLO:
I had been happy if the general camp,
---
## &nbsp;
pioneers and all, had
tasted her sweet body,
---
## &nbsp;
so I had nothing known.
---
## &nbsp;
O’ farewell,
---
## &nbsp;
Othello’s occupation’s gone.
---
## &nbsp;
Villain, be sure thou
prove my love a whore,
---
## &nbsp;
be sure of it, give me the ocular proof,
---
## &nbsp;
or by the worth of man’s eternal soul,
---
## &nbsp;
thou hadst better have been born a dog
---
## &nbsp;
than answer my waked wrath!
---
## &nbsp;
Make me to see’t, or at the least,
---
## &nbsp;
so prove it that the probation
bear no hinge nor loop
---
## &nbsp;
to hang a doubt upon,
or woe upon thy life!
---
## &nbsp;
If thou dost slander her and torture me,
---
## &nbsp;
never pray more, abandon all remorse.
---
## IAGO:
Take note, take note,
---
## &nbsp;
to be direct and honest is not safe.
---
## OTHELLO:
Nay.
---
## &nbsp;
Stay, thou shouldst be honest.
---
## IAGO:
I should be wise, for honesty’s a fool
---
## &nbsp;
and loses that it works for.
---
## OTHELLO:
By heaven, I think my wife be honest,
---
## &nbsp;
and think she is not,
---
## &nbsp;
I think thou art just,
and think thou art not.
---
## &nbsp;
I’ll have some proof,
---
## &nbsp;
would I were satisﬁed!
---
## IAGO:
You would be satisﬁed?
---
## OTHELLO:
Would? Nay, and I will!
---
## IAGO:
And may? But how?
How satisfied, my lord?
---
## &nbsp;
Would you, the supervisor,
grossly gape on?
---
## &nbsp;
Behold her topped?
---
## OTHELLO:
Death and damnation!
---
## IAGO:
It were impossible you should see this
---
## OTHELLO:
O’!
--

## IAGO:
Were they as prime as goats,
---
## &nbsp;
but yet, I say-
---
## OTHELLO:
Give me a living reason she’s disloyal.
---
## IAGO:
Tell me but this,
---
## &nbsp;
have you not sometimes
seen a handkerchief spotted
---
## &nbsp;
with strawberries, in your wife’s hand?
---
## OTHELLO:
I gave her such a one,
’twas my first gift.
---
## IAGO:
O’, I know not that,
but such a handkerchief,
---
## &nbsp;
I’m sure it was your wife’s,
---
## &nbsp;
did I today see Cassio
wipe his beard with.
---
## OTHELLO:
If it be that...
---
## IAGO:
_If_ it be that?
---
## OTHELLO:
O’ that the slave had
forty thousand lives!
---
## &nbsp;
One is too poor, too weak for revenge.
---
## &nbsp;
Now, do I see ’tis true.
---
## &nbsp;
Arise, black vengeance from hollow hell,
---
## &nbsp;
O’,
---
## &nbsp;
blood, blood, blood!
---
## IAGO:
Patience, I say, your
mind perhaps may change.
---
## OTHELLO:
Never, Iago.
---
## &nbsp;
Now, by yond marble heaven,
in the due reverence
---
## &nbsp;
of a sacred vow, I here engage my words.
---
## IAGO:
Do not rise yet.
---
## &nbsp;
Witness, you ever-burning lights above,
---
## &nbsp;
that here Iago doth give up
the execution of his wit,
---
## &nbsp;
hands, heart, to wronged
Othello’s service.
---
## &nbsp;
Let him command and to
obey shall be in me remorse
---
## &nbsp;
what bloody business ever.
---
## OTHELLO:
I greet thy love, not with vain thanks,
---
## &nbsp;
but with acceptance bounteous,
---
## &nbsp;
and will upon the instant put thee to’t.
---
## &nbsp;
Within these three days,
let me hear you say,
---
## &nbsp;
“Cassio’s not alive.”
---
## IAGO:
My friend is dead,
---
## &nbsp;
’tis done, at your command.
---
## &nbsp;
But let her live.
---
## OTHELLO:
Come, go with me. Apart.
---
## &nbsp;
Now, thou art my lieutenant.
---
## IAGO:
I’m your own forever.
---
## DESDEMONA:
Where should I lose
that handkerchief, Emilia?
---
## EMILIA:
I know not, madam.
---
## DESDEMONA:
And but my noble Moor is true of mind,
---
## &nbsp;
and made of no such baseness
as jealous creatures are,
---
## &nbsp;
it were enough to put him to ill-thinking.
---
## EMILIA:
Is he not jealous?
---
## DESDEMONA:
Who, he?
---
## &nbsp;
I think the sun where he was born drew
---
## &nbsp;
all such humors from him.
---
## DESDEMONA:
How is’t with you, my lord?
---
## OTHELLO:
Well, my good lady.
---
## &nbsp;
O’ hardness to dissemble!
---
## &nbsp;
How do you, Desdemona?
---
## DESDEMONA:
Well, my good lord.
---
## OTHELLO:
Give me your hand.
---
## &nbsp;
This hand is moist, my lady.
---
## DESDEMONA:
It yet hath felt no
age, nor known no sorrow.
---
## OTHELLO:
This argues fruitfulness
and liberal heart:
---
## &nbsp;
hot. Hot, and moist.
---
## &nbsp;
This hand of yours requires
---
## &nbsp;
a sequester from liberty,
---
## &nbsp;
fasting and prayer, much purification,
---
## &nbsp;
exercise, devout.
---
## &nbsp;
’Tis a good hand, an honest one.
---
## DESDEMONA:
You may indeed say so,
---
## &nbsp;
for ’twas that hand
that gave away my heart.
---
## &nbsp;
Come, now, your promise.
---
## OTHELLO:
What promise, chuck?
---
## DESDEMONA:
I have sent bid Cassio
come speak with you.
---
## OTHELLO:
Lend me your handkerchief.

## OTHELLO:
Not?
---
## DESDEMONA:
No, faith, my lord.

## OTHELLO:
This is a fault. (laughs)
---
## &nbsp;
That handkerchief did an Egyptian
---
## &nbsp;
to my mother give, she told her,
---
## &nbsp;
that while she kept it,
---
## &nbsp;
‘twould make her amiable
---
## &nbsp;
and subdue my father entirely to her love;
---
## &nbsp;
but if she lost it or made a gift of it,
---
## &nbsp;
my father’s eye should hold her loathed.
---
## &nbsp;
She, dying, gave it me and bid me,
---
## &nbsp;
when my fate would have
me wive, to give it her.
---
## &nbsp;
I did so, and, take heed on’t!
---
## &nbsp;
To lose’t or give’t
away were such perdition
---
## &nbsp;
as nothing else could match.
---
## DESDEMONA:
Is’t possible?
---
## OTHELLO:
’Tis true, there’s
magic in the web of it.

## &nbsp;
The worms were hallowed
that did breed the silk.

## DESDEMONA:
Faith, is’t true?

## OTHELLO:
Most veritable,
therefore, look to’t well.
---
## DESDEMONA:
Then would to God, I had never seen’t!
---
## OTHELLO:
(laughs)
Wherefore?
---
## DESDEMONA:
Why do you speak so startingly and rash?
---
## OTHELLO:
Is’t lost? Is’t gone?
Speak, is’t out o’the way?
---
## DESDEMONA:
I say, it is not lost,
but what an if it were?
---
## OTHELLO:
Fetch’t, let me see’t.
---
## DESDEMONA:
Why, so I can, sir; but I will not now.
---
## &nbsp;
This is a trick to put me from my suit.

Pray you, let Cassio be received again.

## OTHELLO:
Fetch me the handkerchief,
my mind misgives.

## DESDEMONA:
Come, come, you’ll never
meet a more sufficient man.
---
## OTHELLO:
The handkerchief!
--

## DESDEMONA:
Pray, talk me of Cassio.
---
## OTHELLO:
The handkerchief!
---
## DESDEMONA:
A man that all his time hath founded
---
## &nbsp;
his good fortunes on your love,
---
## &nbsp;
shared dangers with you-

## OTHELLO:
The handkerchief!
---

## DESDEMONA:
I’faith, you are to blame.

## OTHELLO:
Zounds!

## EMILIA:
Is not this man jealous?

## DESDEMONA:
I ne’er saw this before,

## &nbsp;
sure there’s some wonder
in this handkerchief.
---
## EMILIA:
’Tis not a year or two shows us a man.
---
## &nbsp;
They are all but stomachs,
and we all but food:
---
## &nbsp;
they eat us hungrily,
and when they are full,
---
## &nbsp;
they belch us.
---
## CASSIO:
Madam, my former suit.
---
## IAGO:
Is my lord angry?
---
## EMILIA:
He went hence but now,
---
## &nbsp;
and certainly in strange unquietness.
---
## IAGO:
Something of moment
then. I will go meet him,
---
## DESDEMONA:
I prithee do so.
---
## &nbsp;
Something sure of state
from Venice hath puddled
---
## &nbsp;
his clear spirit.
---
## &nbsp;
We must think men are not gods.
---
## EMILIA:
I pray it be state matters,
---
## &nbsp;
as you think, and no conception,
---
## &nbsp;
nor no jealous toy, concerning you.
---
## DESDEMONA:
Alas the day, I never gave him cause.
---
## EMILIA:
But jealous souls
will not be answered so:
---
## &nbsp;
they are not ever jealous for the cause,
---
## &nbsp;
they’re jealous for.
---
## &nbsp;
They’re jealous.

It is a monster begot upon itself,

born in itself.

from Othello’s mind!

no, by my faith, Bianca.

Why, whose is it?

Take it, and do’t,

Wherefore?

I do attend here on the general

and think it no addition, nor my wish

to have him see me womaned.

Why, I pray you?

Not that I don’t love you.

But that you love me not.

I pray you, bring me on the way a little,

’Tis but a little way I can bring you

lord, and being hers she may,

## &nbsp;
I think, bestow’t on any man.

## &nbsp;
What if I had said I had
seen him do you wrong?
---
## &nbsp;
Or heard him say-
---
## OTHELLO:
Hath he said anything?
--

## IAGO:
O’, he hath, my lord,
---
## &nbsp;
but be you well assured no
more than he’ll unswear.
---
## OTHELLO:
What hath he said?
---
## IAGO:
Faith, that he did...
---
## OTHELLO:
What?
--

## IAGO:
I know not what. He did-
---
## OTHELLO:
What?
--

## IAGO:
Lie.
---
## OTHELLO:
With her?
---
## IAGO:
With her, on her, what you will.
---
## OTHELLO:
Lie with her?
---
## &nbsp;
Lie on her?
---
## &nbsp;
Zounds, that’s fulsome!
---
## &nbsp;
Handkerchief! Confessions! Handkerchief!
---
## &nbsp;
To confess, and then to
be hanged for his labor!
---
## &nbsp;
First to be hanged, then to confess:
---
## &nbsp;
I tremble at it.
---
## &nbsp;
Lie with her?

Othello gasps and cries

## &nbsp;
Noses, ears, and lips. Is’t possible?

Confess! Handkerchief!

What ho! My lord!

My lord, I say! Othello!

## CASSIO:
What’s the matter?

## IAGO:
My lord is here fallen into a lethargy

## &nbsp;
and must have his quiet course.
---
## &nbsp;
Do you withdraw yourself a little while,
---
## &nbsp;
he will recover straight.
---
## &nbsp;
When he is gone I would on
great occasion speak with you.

Othello breathes slowly
---
## IAGO:
How is it, general?

## &nbsp;
Have you not hurt your head?
---
## OTHELLO:
Dost thou mock me?

## IAGO:
I mock you? No, by heaven!
---
## OTHELLO:
Did he confess it?
---
## IAGO:
Good sir, be a man.
---
## &nbsp;
Whilst you were here
o’erwhelmed with your grief,
---
## &nbsp;
Cassio came hither.
---
## &nbsp;
I shifted him away and laid
good ‘scuse upon your ecstasy,
---
## &nbsp;
bid him anon return
and here speak with me,
---
## &nbsp;
the which he promised.
---
## &nbsp;
Do but encave yourself,
for I will make him tell
---
## &nbsp;
the tale anew where, how,
how oft, how long ago,
---
## &nbsp;
when he hath, and is
again to cope your wife.
---
## &nbsp;
Mary,

## &nbsp;
patience.
---
## IAGO:
How do you now, lieutenant?
---
## CASSIO:
Worser, that you give me the addition
---
## &nbsp;
whose want even kills me.
---
## IAGO:
Ply Desdemona well,
and thou art sure on’t.
---
## &nbsp;
Now, if this suit lay in Bianca’s power,

## &nbsp;
how quickly should you speed! (laughs)

Alas, poor wench!

O’, he laughs already!

## IAGO:
I never knew a woman love man so.

O’, I think i’faith she loves me.

## IAGO:
Faith, she gives it out
that you shall marry her;

do you intend it?

Cassio laughs

## CASSIO:
I, marry! Prithee bear
some charity to my wit.

Prithee say true!

So hangs and lolls and weeps upon me,

so shakes and pulls me! (laughs)
---
## IAGO:
Before me! Look where she comes!
---
## CASSIO:
What do you mean of this haunting of me?
---
## BIANCA:
What did you mean by
that same handkerchief
---
## &nbsp;
you gave me even now?
---
## &nbsp;
I was a fine fool to take it!
---
## &nbsp;
A likely story, that you
should find it in your chamber
---
## &nbsp;
and not know who left it there!
---
## &nbsp;
This is some minx’s token.
---
## &nbsp;
There, give it your hobby-horse;
---
## &nbsp;
wheresoever you had it!
---
## &nbsp;
If you’ll come to supper tonight, you may;
---
## &nbsp;
but if you will not, come when
you are next prepared for it.
---
## CASSIO:
How now, my sweet Bianca.
---
## CASSIO:
How now?
---
## &nbsp;
How now?
---
## OTHELLO:
By heaven, that should
be my handkerchief.
---
## &nbsp;
How do I murder him, Iago?
---
## IAGO:
Did you perceive how
he laughed at his vice?
---
## OTHELLO:
O’, Iago!
---
## &nbsp;
I’d have him nine years a-killing.
---
## &nbsp;
A fine woman, a fair woman, a sweet woman!
---
## IAGO:
Nay, you must forget that.
---
## OTHELLO:
No, my heart is turned to stone:
---
## &nbsp;
I strike it, and it hurts my hand.
---
## &nbsp;
O’, the world hath not a sweeter creature.
---
## &nbsp;
Cuckold me!
---
## &nbsp;
And with mine officer!
---
## &nbsp;
Iago, this night.
---
## &nbsp;
I’ll not expostulate with her,
---
## &nbsp;
lest her body and beauty
unprovide my mind again.
---
## &nbsp;
This night, Iago.
---
## OTHELLO:
You have seen nothing, then?
---
## EMILIA:
Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.
---
## OTHELLO:
Yes, you have seen Cassio and...
---
## &nbsp;
She together.
---
## EMILIA:
But then I saw no harm,
---
## &nbsp;
and then I heard each syllable
---
## &nbsp;
that breath made up between them.
---
## OTHELLO:
What, did they never whisper?
--

## EMILIA:
Never, my lord.
---

## OTHELLO:
Nor send you out o’th’ way?
---
## EMILIA:
Never.
---
## EMILIA:
I durst, my lord, to
wager she is honest,
---
## &nbsp;
lay down my soul at stake:
---
## &nbsp;
if you think other, remove your thought,
---
## &nbsp;
it doth abuse your bosom.
---
## &nbsp;
If any wretch have put this in your head,
---
## &nbsp;
let heaven requite it
with the serpent’s curse,
---
## &nbsp;
for if she be not honest, chaste and true
---
## &nbsp;
there’s no man happy:
---
## &nbsp;
the purest of their
wives is foul as slander.
---
## OTHELLO:
Go.
---
## DESDEMONA:
My lord, what is your will?
---
## OTHELLO:
Pray, chuck, come hither.
---
## DESDEMONA:
What is your pleasure?
---
## OTHELLO:
Look at my face. Let me see your eyes.
---
## DESDEMONA:
What horrible fancy is this?
---
## OTHELLO:
Why, what art thou?
---
## DESDEMONA:
Your wife, my lord:
your true and loyal wife.
---
## OTHELLO:
Come, swear it.
---
## &nbsp;
Damn thyself, swear thou art honest!
---
## DESDEMONA:
Heaven doth truly know it.
---
## OTHELLO:
Heaven doth truly know
thou art false as hell.
---
## DESDEMONA:
To whom, my lord? With
whom? How am I false?
---
## OTHELLO:
Ah, Desdemona.
---
## &nbsp;
Away,
---
## &nbsp;
away,
---
## &nbsp;
away!
---
## DESDEMONA:
Alas the heavy day, why do you weep?
---
## &nbsp;
Am I the motive of these tears, my lord?
---
## OTHELLO:
Had it pleased heaven
---
## &nbsp;
to try me with affliction,
---
## &nbsp;
had they rained all
kinds of sores and shames
---
## &nbsp;
upon my bare head,
---
## &nbsp;
I should have found in
some place of my soul
---
## &nbsp;
a drop of patience;
---
## &nbsp;
but there, where I have
garnered up my heart,
---
## &nbsp;
where either I must live or bear no life,
---
## &nbsp;
you are the fountain from
the which my current runs
---
## &nbsp;
or else dries up, to be discarded thence!
---
## &nbsp;
O’ thou who art so lovely
fair and smell’st so sweet
---
## &nbsp;
that sense aches at thee,
---
## &nbsp;
would thou hadst ne’er been born!

## DESDEMONA:
Alas, what ignorant
sin have I committed?

## OTHELLO:
Was this fair paper,
this most goodly book made

## &nbsp;
to write ‘whore’ upon? What committed!
---
## &nbsp;
Impudent strumpet!
---
## DESDEMONA:
By heaven, you do me wrong.
---
## OTHELLO:
Are not you a strumpet?
---
## DESDEMONA:
No, as I am a Christian, I am none.
---
## OTHELLO:
What, not a whore?
---
## DESDEMONA:
No, as I shall be saved.

## OTHELLO:
Is’t possible?

## DESDEMONA:
O’ heaven, forgive us!

I cry you mercy then,

## &nbsp;
I took you for that
cunning whore of Venice

## &nbsp;
that married with Othello.

---
## EMILIA:
How do you, madam? How
do you, my good lady?
---
## DESDEMONA:
Faith, half asleep.

## EMILIA:
Madam, what’s the matter with my lord?
---
## DESDEMONA:
With whom?
---
## EMILIA:
Why, with my lord, madam.
---
## DESDEMONA:
Who is thy lord?
---
## EMILIA:
He that is yours, sweet lady.
---
## DESDEMONA:
I have none. Do not speak to me, Emilia;
---
## &nbsp;
I cannot weep, nor answers have I none
---
## &nbsp;
but what should go by water.
---
## &nbsp;
Prithee, tonight lay on
my bed my wedding sheets;
---
## &nbsp;
remember, and call thy husband hither.
---
## DESDEMONA:
Am I that name, Iago?
---
## IAGO:
What name, fair lady?
---
## EMILIA:
He called her whore.
---
## IAGO:
Why did he so?
---
## DESDEMONA:
I do not know; I am sure I am none such.
---
## EMILIA:
Hath she forsook so many noble matches,
---
## &nbsp;
and her father, and her
country, and her friends,
---
## &nbsp;
to be called whore?
---
## IAGO:
How came this trick upon him?
---
## EMILIA:
I will be hanged if
some eternal villain,
---
## &nbsp;
some busy and insinuating rogue,
---
## &nbsp;
some cogging, cozening
slave, to get some office,
---
## &nbsp;
have not yet devised this slander!
---
## IAGO:
Fie, there is no such
man, it is impossible.
---
## DESDEMONA:
If any such there be, heaven pardon him.
---
## EMILIA:
Why should he call her
whore? Who keeps her company?
---
## &nbsp;
What place, what time,
what form, what likelihood?
---
## &nbsp;
The Moor’s been abused by
some most villainous knave.
---
## IAGO:
Speak within doors.
---
## EMILIA:
O’ fie upon them!
---
## &nbsp;
Some such squire he was
that turned your reason
---
## &nbsp;
to the seamy side without
and made you to suspect me
---
## &nbsp;
with the Moor.
---
## IAGO:
You’re a fool, go to.
---
## DESDEMONA:
Good, Iago,
---
## &nbsp;
What shall I do to win my lord again?
---
## &nbsp;
Good friend, go to him.
---
## &nbsp;
For, by this light of heaven,
---
## &nbsp;
I know not how I lost him.
---
## IAGO:
I pray you, be content,
’tis but his humor;
---
## &nbsp;
the business of the state
does him some offense.
---
## DESDEMONA:
If ‘twere no other-
--

## IAGO:
’Tis but so, I warrant,
---
## IAGO:
Go, and weep not; all
things shall be well.

Roderigo claps
---
## IAGO:
How now, Roderigo?
---
## RODERIGO:
I do not find that thou
deal’st justly with me.
---
## IAGO:
What in the contrary?
---
## RODERIGO:
Every day thou doff’st
me with some device, Iago.
---
## &nbsp;
The jewels that you have had from me
---
## &nbsp;
to deliver to Desdemona,
---
## &nbsp;
would half have corrupted a votarist.
---
## &nbsp;
You’ve told me she hath received them,
---
## &nbsp;
and returned me expectations and comforts
---
## &nbsp;
of sudden respect and
acquaintance, but I find none!
---
## &nbsp;
I will make myself known to Desdemona:
---
## &nbsp;
if she will return me my
jewels, I’ll give over my suit;
---
## &nbsp;
if not, assure yourself
---
## &nbsp;
that I will seek satisfaction of you!
---
## IAGO:
Give me thy hand, Roderigo.
---
## &nbsp;
Thou hast taken against
me a most just offense,
---
## &nbsp;
but yet, I confess,
---
## &nbsp;
I have dealt most directly in thy affair.
---
## RODERIGO:
It hath not appeared.
---
## IAGO:
Roderigo, if thou hast
that courage in thee indeed,
---
## &nbsp;
which, I have greater reason
to believe now than ever,
---
## &nbsp;
this night show it.
---
## &nbsp;
If thou the next night
following enjoy not Desdemona,
---
## &nbsp;
take me from this world with treacheries
---
## &nbsp;
and devise plans to take my life.
---
## RODERIGO:
Well, what is it?
---
## &nbsp;
Is it within reason and compass?
---
## IAGO:
There is especial
commission come from Venice,
---
## &nbsp;
appointing Cassio in Othello’s place.
---
## RODERIGO:
Is that true?
---
## &nbsp;
Then Othello returns again to Venice.
---
## IAGO:
Taking away with him the fair Desdemona,
---
## &nbsp;
unless his abode be lingered
here by some accident
---
## &nbsp;
like the removing of Cassio.
---
## RODERIGO:
How do you mean, the removing of Cassio?
---
## IAGO:
Making him uncapable of Othello’s place:
---
## &nbsp;
knocking out his brains.
---
## RODERIGO:
And that you would have me to do?
---
## IAGO:
I will be near to second your attempt.
---
---
## RODERIGO:
I will hear further reason for this.
---
## IAGO:
If Cassio do remain, he hath
a daily beauty in his life
---
## &nbsp;
that makes me ugly;
---
## &nbsp;
besides the Moor may unfold me to him.

Be’t so!

---
## &nbsp;
But once put out thy light,
---
## &nbsp;
thou cunning’st pattern
of excelling nature,
---
## &nbsp;
I know not where that Promethean heat
---
## &nbsp;
that can thy light relume:
---
## &nbsp;
once I have plucked the rose,
---
## &nbsp;
I cannot give it vital growth again,
---
## &nbsp;
it needs must wither.
---
## &nbsp;
I’ll smell thee on the tree.

## DESDEMONA:
Who’s there?

## &nbsp;
Othello?
---
## OTHELLO:
Ay, Desdemona.
---
## DESDEMONA:
Will you come to bed, my lord?
---
## OTHELLO:
Have you prayed tonight, Desdemona?
---
## DESDEMONA:
Ay, my lord.
---
## OTHELLO:
If you bethink yourself of any crime,
---
## &nbsp;
unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace,
---
## &nbsp;
solicit for it straight.
---
## DESDEMONA:
My lord, what may you mean by that?
---
## OTHELLO:
Well, just do it; I will walk by.
---
## &nbsp;
I would not kill thy
unprepared spirit, no,
---
## &nbsp;
heaven forfend, I would not kill thy soul.
---
## DESDEMONA:
Talk you of killing?
---
## OTHELLO:
Ay, I do.
---
## DESDEMONA:
Then, heaven, have mercy on me!
---
## OTHELLO:
Amen, with all my heart.
---
## DESDEMONA:
If you say so, I hope
you will not kill me.

## OTHELLO:
Think on thy sins.

## DESDEMONA:
They are loves I bear to you.
---
## OTHELLO:
Ay, and for that thou diest.
---
## DESDEMONA:
That death’s unnatural
that kills for loving.
---
## OTHELLO:
Peace, and be still.
---
## DESDEMONA:
I will.
---
## &nbsp;
So, what’s the matter?
---
## OTHELLO:
That handkerchief, which
I so loved and gave thee,
---
## &nbsp;
thou gavest Cassio.
---
## DESDEMONA:
No, by my life and soul:
---
## &nbsp;
send for the man and ask him.
---
## OTHELLO:
Take heed, sweet soul,
take heed of perjury.
---
## &nbsp;
Thou art on thy death-bed.
---
## DESDEMONA:
I? But not yet to die.
---
## OTHELLO:
Yes, presently.
---
## DESDEMONA:
Then Lord have mercy on me.
---
## OTHELLO:
I say, Amen.
---
## DESDEMONA:
And have you mercy too.
---
## &nbsp;
I never did offend you in
my life, never loved Cassio!
---
## &nbsp;
But with such general warranty of heaven
---
## &nbsp;
as I might love: I never gave him token.
---
## OTHELLO:
By heaven, I saw my
handkerchief in his hand!
---
## DESDEMONA:
He found it, then, I never gave it him.
---
## &nbsp;
Send for him hither, let
him confess the truth.
---
## OTHELLO:
He hath confessed.
---
## DESDEMONA:
What, my lord?
---
## OTHELLO:
That he hath used thee.
---
## DESDEMONA:
How? Unlawfully?
---
## OTHELLO:
Ay.
---
## DESDEMONA:
He will not say so.
---
## OTHELLO:
No, his mouth is stopped.
---
## &nbsp;
Honest Iago hath ta’en order for’t.
---
## DESDEMONA:
O’, alas...
---
## &nbsp;
He is betrayed, and I undone.
---
## OTHELLO:
Out, strumpet, weep’st
thou for him to my face?
---
## DESDEMONA:
Banish me, my lord, but kill me not!
---
## OTHELLO:
Down, strumpet!
---
## DESDEMONA:
Kill me tomorrow, let me live tonight!
---
## OTHELLO:
Nay, if you strive.
---
## DESDEMONA:
But half an hour!
---
## OTHELLO:
Being done, there is no pause.
---
## DESDEMONA:
But while I say one prayer!
---
## OTHELLO:
It is too late.
---
## DESDEMONA:
O’!
---
## OTHELLO:
It is too late.
---
## DESDEMONA:
Lord!

Lord!

But now, my lord.

## &nbsp;
Cassio, my lord, hath killed
a Venetian, called Roderigo.
---
## OTHELLO:
Roderigo killed? And Cassio killed?
---
## &nbsp;
No, Cassio is not killed.
---
## OTHELLO:
Not Cassio killed?

O’!

O’ lord, what cry is that?

Who hath done this deed?

’Twas I that killed her.

## EMILIA:
The more angel she, and
you the blacker devil!
---
## OTHELLO:
She was false as water.
---
## EMILIA:
Thou art rash as fire
to say she was false.
---
## OTHELLO:
Cassio did top her:
ask thy husband else.
---
## &nbsp;
O’, I be damned beneath all depth in hell
---
## &nbsp;
but that I did proceed upon just grounds
---
## &nbsp;
to this extremity.
---
## &nbsp;
Thy husband knew it all!
---
## EMILIA:
My husband?
--

## OTHELLO:
Thy husband.
---
## EMILIA:
That she was false?
--

## OTHELLO:
Ay, with Cassio.
---
## EMILIA:
My husband?
---
## OTHELLO:
Ay, ’twas he that told me on her first.
---
## EMILIA:
My husband!
---
## OTHELLO:
What needs this iterance, woman?
---
## &nbsp;
I say, “thy husband.”
---
## EMILIA:
But my husband say she was false?
---
## OTHELLO:
He, woman;
---
## &nbsp;
I say thy husband: dost
understand the word?
---
## &nbsp;
My friend, thy husband,
---
## &nbsp;
honest, honest Iago.
---
## EMILIA:
If he say so, may his
pernicious soul rot half
---
## &nbsp;
a grain a day.
---
## &nbsp;
He lies to th’ heart:
---
## &nbsp;
she was too fond of her
most filthy bargain!
---
## &nbsp;
This deed of thine is
no more worthy heaven
---
## &nbsp;
than thou wast worthy her.
---
## OTHELLO:
Peace, you were best!
---
## EMILIA:
Thou hast not half
that power to do me harm
---
## &nbsp;
as I have to be hurt.
---
## &nbsp;
As ignorant as dirt!
---
## &nbsp;
Thou hadst done a deed.
---
## &nbsp;
I’ll make thee known.
---
## &nbsp;
Though I lost twenty lives.
---
## &nbsp;
Help!
---
## &nbsp;
The Moor hath killed my mistress!
---
## EMILIA:
Murder!
---
## &nbsp;
Murder!
---
## IAGO:
What is the
matter? How now, general?
---
## EMILIA:
O’, are you come, Iago?
---
## &nbsp;
You have done well that
men must lay their murders
---
## &nbsp;
on your neck.
---
## IAGO:
What’s the matter?
---
## EMILIA:
Disprove this villain,
if thou be’st a man;
---
## &nbsp;
he says thou told’st him
that his wife was false!
---
## IAGO:
I told him what I
thought, and told no more
---
## &nbsp;
than what he found
himself was apt and true.
---
## EMILIA:
But did you ever tell him she was false?
---
## IAGO:
I did.
---
## EMILIA:
You told a lie, an odious, damned lie!
---
## &nbsp;
Upon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie!
---
## &nbsp;
She was false with Cassio?
---
## &nbsp;
Did you say with Cassio?
---
## IAGO:
With Cassio, mistress.
---
## &nbsp;
Go to, charm your tongue.
---
## EMILIA:
I will not charm my
tongue, I am bound to speak:
---
## &nbsp;
my mistress here lies murdered in her bed.
---
## &nbsp;
And your reports have set the murder on.
---
## OTHELLO:
It is true indeed.
---
## EMILIA:
Villainy, villainy, villainy!
---
## &nbsp;
I think upon’t, I think,
I smell’t, O’ villainy!
---
## &nbsp;
I thought so then.
---
## OTHELLO:
What, are you mad? I
charge you, get you home.
---
## EMILIA:
Perchance, Iago, I will ne’er go home.
---
## OTHELLO:
O’, she was foul.
---
## &nbsp;
Iago knows that she with
Cassio hath the act of shame
---
## &nbsp;
a thousand times committed.
---
## &nbsp;
Cassio confessed it,
---
## &nbsp;
and she did gratify his amorous works
---
## &nbsp;
with that pledge of love,
which I first gave her.
---
## &nbsp;
It was a handkerchief. An
antique token of my mother’s.
---
## EMILIA:
Let heaven and men and
devils, let them all,
---
## &nbsp;
all, all cry shame against
me, yet. I’ll speak.
---
## IAGO:
Be wise, and get you home.
--

## EMILIA:
I will not.
---
## EMILIA:
O’ thou dull Moor, that
handkerchief thou speak’st of,
---
## &nbsp;
I found by fortune and
did give it my husband.
---
## &nbsp;
He begged me to steal it!
---
## &nbsp;
She give it Cassio?
---
## &nbsp;
Alas, no, I found it and
I did give’t my husband.

I am not sorry neither,
I’d have thee live:

for in my sense ’tis happiness to die.

## MONTANO:
Othello, what shall be said of thee?
---
## OTHELLO:
Why, anything;
---
## &nbsp;
an honorable murderer, if you will,
---
## &nbsp;
for nought I did in
hate, but all in honor.
---
## MONTANO:
Did you and he consent
in Cassio’s death?
---
## OTHELLO:
Ay.
---
## CASSIO:
Dear general,
I never gave you cause.
---
## OTHELLO:
I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.
---
## &nbsp;
Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil
---
## &nbsp;
why he hath thus ensnared
my soul and body?
---
## IAGO:
Demand me nothing.
What you know, you know.
---
## &nbsp;
From this time forth, I
never will speak word.
---
## OTHELLO:
Well, thou dost best.

How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief

that was my wife’s?

I found it in my chamber.

You must forsake this room
---
## &nbsp;
and go with us.
---
## &nbsp;
Your power and your command are taken off
---
## &nbsp;
and Cassio rules in Cyprus.
---
## &nbsp;
You shall a prisoner remain till that
---
## &nbsp;
the nature of your faults be known
---
## &nbsp;
to the Venetian state.
---
## &nbsp;
Come, away.
---
## OTHELLO:
Soft you, a word or two before you go.
---
## &nbsp;
I have done the state some
service, and they know’t.
---
## &nbsp;
No more of that.
---
## &nbsp;
I pray you,
---
## &nbsp;
in your letters,
---
## &nbsp;
when you shall these unlucky deeds relate,
---
## &nbsp;
speak of me as I am.
---
## &nbsp;
Nothing extenuate, nor
set down aught in malice.
---
## &nbsp;
Then, must you speak of
one that loved not wisely,
---
## &nbsp;
but too well;
---
## &nbsp;
of one not easily jealous,
---
## &nbsp;
but, being wrought,
perplexed in the extreme;
---
## &nbsp;
of one whose hand, like
the Judas Iscariot,
---
## &nbsp;
threw a pearl away richer
than all his tribe;
---
## &nbsp;
of one whose subdued eyes,
---
## &nbsp;
albeit unused to the melting mood,
---
## &nbsp;
drops tears as fast as the Arabian trees
---
## &nbsp;
their medicinable gum.
---
## &nbsp;
Set you down this, and say
besides that in Aleppo once,
---
## &nbsp;
where a malignant and a
turbanned Turk beat a Venetian
---
## &nbsp;
and traduced the state,
---
## &nbsp;
I took by th’ throat, the circumcised dog,
---
## &nbsp;
and smote him, and thus! (groans)
