## BEATRICE ETHEL APPLETON:
The point was that pretty much everyone
---
had it wrong about happiness.
---
So everyone's always
talking about happiness,
---
like it's something complete
and whole and distinct,
---
and like you'd notice it
if it happened to come by.
---
But it's not like that.
---
Happiness is ordinary misery
without extraordinary fear.
---
Or in a nutshell, happiness
is the temporary illusion
---
that nothing is about
to change for the worse.
---
That's happiness.
---
And while you have it,
all's you can think is,
---
_this ain't happiness_.
---
And then the moment it's
over, you think, that was it.
---
That _was_ happiness.
---
This is what I was
thinking as I was crying,
---
sitting in the ladies
lavatory of the Plaza Athenee
---
on 63rd Street on April 23rd 1961
---
when Frances Ethel Gumm
---
happened to come in for a pee.
---
George had told me that
very night that it was over.
---
He was leaving and he took
the keys to the rambler,
---
and the door closed after him,
and I didn't see it coming.
---
All that time with George,
I thought I wasn't happy
---
because things didn't _zing_.
---
And then he left.
---
And I realized that _that's_
what happiness looked like.
---
It was something small
and reliable and ordinary.
---
Maybe that's the point of happiness.
---
It only exists as memory.
---
We had our rituals,
---
and I thought that was
what marriage was about,
---
creating rituals and fitting into them,
---
but he didn't like that.
---
Wasn't happy enough of the time.
---
Or maybe it's just that he
was happier somewhere else,
---
_with_ someone else who possibly
was a red-headed waitress
---
at Sam Chinita's on 8th and 19th.
---
So evening in Paris,
Diorella, Apple Blossom,
---
all the bottles lined up,
---
along with some hair maintenance products
---
and quick fix items, bobby
pins, safety pins, sewing kit,
---
nail polish for stocking
runs, sanitary items,
---
and face powder for those who were glowing
---
with unsightly fervor.
---
April 23rd 1961 started out a dull night.
---
There were some Park Avenue matrons
---
out for dinner and dancing,
---
most of them too fat for their
dresses and too lousy to tip.
---
But as they went in and
out of the ladies room,
---
I had just got caught up in
how fast things had changed.
---
A couple of nights back I
thought I had a pretty good job
---
and a pretty good life,
and now it seemed pathetic
---
to be sitting there with
some perfume atomisers
---
and hair lacquer and hand towels.
---
At 36 years of age, no
children and a husband
---
moving into the shadows
of the future without me.
---
That's when Frances Ethel entered
---
wearing a black shift dress
with a stiff silk evening coat
---
with mink collar.
---
Actually, not even five foot,
that's what gave it away.
---
Just this little doll in kitten heels
---
and theatrical make-up.
---
And then I remembered, Carnegie Hall,
---
that Judy was singing a few blocks away,
---
and now it was 11.30 p.m.,
---
and now she was in here, having a pee.
---
And that's the first time
I ever saw Judy Garland.
---
Many people subsequently
called that concert,
---
the greatest night in show business.
---
But of course nobody knew that then.
---
It was just the night that
followed the night before.
---
Yeah, and technically,
---
the first time I ever saw
Judy Garland was in 1939,
---
when Granny Louisa Appleton
---
took me to a jam-packed
Saturday matinee to see,
---
well you know what we saw.
---
Judy Garland as Dorothy
Gale in _The Wizard of Oz_.
---
And then a year later,
---
we saw her play a beautiful
debutante seducing Mickey Rooney
---
in _Andy Hardy Meets a Debutante_.
---
I was always gonna see
anything Judy Garland was in,
---
because Frances Ethel Gumm
---
was born in Grand Rapids, Minnesota,
---
and so was Beatrice
Ethel Appleton, being me.
---
Only when I was born, Frances
Ethel was three years older,
---
but we were both baptized
in the Episcopal Church
---
on the corner of Cody and Willowbank,
---
right next to what is now
the "Kentucky Fried" franchise.
---
So being a Grand Rapids girl,
---
everybody was interested in
Judy Garland in Grand Rapids,
---
from the get-go.
---
Apart from anything else,
---
she was living proof you could
get the hell out of there.
---
So, I thought to myself, I thought,
---
"This is Judy Garland,"
---
and she was looking at
herself in the mirror,
---
checking out her lipstick,
---
and what I noticed that her
hem had snagged on something,
---
it was coming down at the back.
---
It might seem strange to have Judy Garland
---
two feet away from you, and
to notice that little detail,
---
but that little detail was my job.
---
"Miss Garland, your hem is
coming down in the back."
---
And she said, "Oh, gosh."

---
"I have a needle and thread,
---
and I'd be happy to…" 
---
[in Judy Garland voice] 
"Oh, no, no, I couldn't…oh!"
---
[regular voice] 
"It would only take me a couple of minutes."
---
And she smiled.
---
She sat down on my stool.
---
I knelt on the floor.
---
(sighs) Hello, I said to myself, "Hello,"
---
I am holding the edge
of Judy Garland's dress!
---
I am brushing her leg with my hand,
---
feeling her breath on my neck as I sew.
---
I heard a short guy in a wig
shouting in the front row.
---
Short guy, fat, expensively dressed
---
but that didn't help any,
---
sitting next to this
itty bitty little beauty,
---
that couldn't be more than 19 years old
---
in chartreuse chiffon.
---
And well, I could barely
concentrate for thinking
---
what kind of world it was,
---
where those two were the
perfect halves of a whole.
---
She was light and funny and alive
---
like nothing I'd ever seen.
---
"You've been crying."
---
I said nothing to that.
---
I had a live, living, 100%
movie star in my midst,
---
and Bea Appleton's husband problems
---
belonged in a different universe.
---
"Well, what happened?"
---
"Oh, Miss Garland, really it's just…"
---
"…no, no, no, no, come on, let it out."
---
"Miss Garland, it's just
nothing, it's just…nothing."
---
Nothing.
---
And it was my life that
was vanishing before me.
---
It was everything George and me had made.
---
It was Christmases and long weekends.
---
Fireside suppers and
skating in the winter.
---
It was anniversary
dinners and shared jokes
---
that no one else could get.
---
And it was a strange
little world, our world,
---
but when you get down to it,
---
what world isn't that
revolves around two people
---
within four walls?
---
So I knotted the thread and
used I used my teeth to break it
---
and I told her, "Oh," and I cried.
---
All right then finally, I said to her,
---
"Miss Garland, here is the thing.
---
I think that happiness is
not a good thing in itself
---
so much as the absence of something bad.
---
Happiness is just two flawed human beings
---
who don't allow what
they despise in the other
---
to overwhelm what they admire."
---
And Judy looked at me intently,
---
and she smudged a tear from my face.
---
Judy Garland smudged my face.
---
"What's your name, honey?"
---
"Beatrice Ethel Appleton, but I go by Bea."
---
"Bea Appleton, you see more
than what most people see."
---
I see more than what most people see.
---
Yes, I do.
---
_Yes_, I do.
---
Bea Appleton is not a loser!
---
Despite George, despite
George driving away from me,
---
one block, two, three, four,
---
before taking a right by Filene's.
---
And I looked at her, into
those dark velvet eyes,
---
and she looked at me.
---
At _me_.
---
Bea Appleton, philosopher.

She is up there.

She's always center stage and it appears,

although it is not
true, that she is alone.

She does not share the light.

And I am behind her.
---
I'm always to the side of the stage.
---
I am never alone.
---
I always share the light.
---
Here is how you never hear me sing.
---

---

---
Now, who is she?
---
She is Tammy Wynette, Loretta Lynn,
---
Brenda Lee, Kitty Wells, Dottie West.
---
I sang in their shadows.
---
But I'm getting ahead of myself,
---
because until I was 23 years old,
---
I never thought I'd be more than an usher
---
at The Soldiers and Sailors
Memorial Hall in Kansas City.
---
I liked the work, 'cause I
got to hear real singers.
---
Yeah, the kinds of singers I
bought records of as a teenager
---
at Robbie Boxer's record
store just off of Main Street.
---
But as I stood there,
with my little flashlight,
---
showin' folk to their allocated seats,
---
I nurtured…
---
well, I _allowed_ myself to be caught up
---
in the words of the songs
floatin' across the auditorium.
---
I sailed away on those lyrics.
---
I had a dream.
---
Now, in this country,
---
people are always talkin' about dreams.
---
You can have your dream.
---
You can be your dream.
---
You can live the dream.
---
But that's just a clever way
of getting' people to shut up
---
and stop complainin'.

---
If people think they can have their dream,
---
they stop makin' trouble.
---
And then one morning at about 34,
you wake up and you think
---
that not very many people live a dream.
---
And that the best advice is
not to follow your dream.
---
It's adjust your dream.
---
Now, when we're little children
and we want to be somethin',
---
somebody should shake us and
look into our eyes and say,
---
lower your expectations.

---
Which is what I did.
---
So I became the voice that
you hear but never name.
---
Now, lot's of voices sound better alone
---
but others sound better with company.
---
Now, my voice has size,
but it also has modesty.
---
It's a voice so darn sure of itself,
---
it doesn't need the acclaim to prop it up.
---
But, a great singer has
more than a great voice,
---
they have the kind of personality
that catches the light.
---
They got so much natural
fuel inside of them,
---
they can light a fuse in another person.
---
And I've always been a popular person,
---
but there's more than one of
me out there, more or less.
---
Johnnie says he never wanted a star.
---
He said he liked me because I reminded him
---
of the kind of woman who
married the kind of man he was.
---
But there were never any more of Patsy.
---
You just knew she was the one and only.
---
And until March the 3rd 1963,
I was singin' on the sly.
---
It was Patsy who showed
me what I should be.
---
Cactus Jack Call had driven
himself into a brick-wall,
---
and him bein' a very well
known disc jockey of the time,
---
a lot of people who felt
they owed him somethin'.
---
So somebody called around,
---
pretty soon there was quite a line up
---
willin' to come back to Kansas City,
---
and put on a fund-raiser for his family.
---
The Jones Boys, Hawkshaw
Hawkins, Stoney Cooper,
---
and Wilma Lee, the Clinch
Mountain Boys, the Georges.
---
Riddle and Jones and
McCormick and Dottie West.
---
Now, as luck would have it,
---
I was rostered on at
the hall that evening,
---
and the first thing Maddy
Bartholomew says to me
---
when I got to work is,
"Patsy's come down too.
---
Dottie West says she's not too
happy about leaving the kids,
---
but she'll do it for Cactus Jack."
---
It made perfect sense that
Patsy would end the show,
---
because nobody ended the
show the way Patsy could.
---
Now, backstage, it was
like the Grand Ole Opry.
---
I was supposed to fix some light
bulbs in the dressing rooms
---
and I saw just about
everyone I had ever idolized
---
comin' and goin' to the sound-checks,
---
drinkin' coffee, or somethin' stronger,
---
and kissin', and huggin'.
---
I was told there was a bulb missin'
---
in dressing room number two,
---
which was supposed to
have the Jones Boys in it.
---
So I knocked and I called
out, "Y'all decent?"
---
I heard a yell, which I
took to be an affirmative,
---
so I opened the door and
there was Patsy Cline.
---
She was in a white chiffon
dress, just lookin' right at me.
---
And I said, "Oh my Lord,
Miss Cline, I'm so sorry.
---
I thought you were in
the other dressin' room."
---
And she said, "Honey, we
switched, the other one is bigger,
---
and there were all those
boys to fit in this one
---
and only me in that one."
---
I said, "Oh, it's an
honor to have you here
---
at the Memorial Hall,
---
and you are my absolutely
favorite singer of all time."
---
And she smiled and asked me my name.
---
I said, "My name is Pearl Avalon."
---
And she said, "Is that a made up name?"
---
I said, "No, ma'am, that's the
name I've had since birth."
---
And she said, "So you're an
usher right here at the venue?"
---
I said, "Yes, ma'am, I am."
---
And she said, "Do you
like your job, Pearl?"
---
I said, "Yes, because
I like to sing myself,
---
only my favorite venue is my own porch."
---
And she laughed,
---
and I said, "Well, I don't suppose
---
you still sing on your porch, Ms Cline?"
---
And she said, "Honey,
that's the sad truth.
---
I wish I did.
---
The thing is I've become a captive.
---
A captive.
---
A captive of my own ambitions".
---
"Well, it must be wonderful to
walk out there on the stage
---
and make people feel so much
just by opening up your mouth."
---
Isn't that just the best
feelin' in the world?
---
And she said, "Pearl, honey,
---
we all have our midnight demons.
---
A lot of people say you've got
all the lovin' in the world
---
when you walk out onstage.
---
All that applause don't help you any
---
when you're layin' in that bed at night."
---
And I thought to myself,
---
Patsy Cline has midnight demons, too.
---
And then she said, "Sing
me something, Pearl
---
'cause I'm superstitious,
---
and I feel like you might
bring me some luck."

And when it was over, she looked at me,
---
and I just thought to myself,
---
"Woo, I just sang for Patsy Cline!
---
Woo hoo!"

---
And I was mad as hell there was no witness
---
because who but the good
Lord would believe me?
---
And just then, a voice came
through the loudspeaker saying,
---
"Miss Cline to the stage please.
---
She got up and walked
past me, up to the stage.
---
And I walked off carrying two
perfectly good light bulbs.
---
So Stoney Cooper and Wilma Lee
sang and then Hawkshaw sang,
---
Dog House Boogie, and the crowd was great,
---
and the place was full to bustin'.
---
And you could feel like the
show was movin' towards the end
---
but the audience knew, they
knew that Patsy was comin'.
---
And the shiny exhilarated anticipation
---
hung over the auditorium.
---
Woo, you could feel it, you
could just about see it.
---
Then Hawkshaw left the stage
and the crowd started chantin',
---
"Patsy, Patsy, Patsy."
---
And then she came out
---
like the Almighty himself
was shinin' a light on her.
---
And she began to sing.

---
So she looking down into the audience.
---
I'm standin' about half way
down the right hand aisle,
---
I'm just leanin' against
a column and watching.
---
Well, she looks right around,
---
puts her hand out in my direction,
---
beckons somebody and I thought,
---
the manager, Randy Hughes, he
must be sittin' right by me,
---
well, I just looked around

---
there was no one but some
teenagers hollerin' and clappin',
---
but just, and the stage manager,
---
a guy named Freddy Fats O'Donohue.
---
He comes out the side door and says to me,
---
"She wants you to sing backing vocals."
---
And he pulled me through the side door,
---
up the side stairs and into the wings.
---
Oh, there is Pasty, and
she's looking out at me,
---
and she winked.
---
Somebody pushed me next to a microphone
---
in the shadows behind her, and I sang.
---

After it's all over, we're
standin' in the wings
---
and she said to me,
"Thank you, Pearl Avalon,"
---
like I'd done her a favor.

---
And just then Dottie West
comes boundin' up just saying,
---
"How are you getting' back home Pasty?"
---
And Patsy said that Randy'd
got ahold of a Piper Comanche,
---
and she and Hawkshaw, and Cowboy Copas
---
were all flyin' back to
Nashville this instant.
---
And Dottie said, "Patsy, get in our car,
---
and we'll drive you back to Nashville.
---
You know how I feel about small planes."
---
And Patsy said, "Dottie, I
wanna see my kids tonight,
---
and I want to see their
little heads on the pillow,
---
and don't you worry about me.
---
When it's my time to go, it's my time."
---
And I never really got to say goodbye,
---
'cause just then Maddy Bartholomew
---
was yellin' somethin'
to me about Wilma Lee
---
droppin' her earring down the drain
---
and needin' my flashlight.
---
And I turned around just in time
---
to see the top of Randy Hughes' head
---
as they made their way through the crowd.
---
It was Johnnie who told me,
he woke me with the news.
---
And it somehow seemed preordained
---
because everythin' Patsy did was big,
---
just as big as her voice.
---
She took off bound for Nashville,
---
and she never made it home.
---
So, I never brought Patsy Cline any luck,
---
but Patsy Cline, she brought me plenty.

## EDIE DELAMOTTE:
[with British accent] 
Sometimes, when the night is very dark
---
and the city lights are far away,
---
and the universe seems
right there, before us,
---
populated by millions of
flickering possibilities,
---
I look up and I try to work
out which one it might be.

QUI LUI REMPLIT SON BAS
---
Let's start at the beginning.
---
How many times do you hear that and think,
---
"let's _not_."
---
Let's not start at the beginning
---
because then when we suspect,
the story's going to be long.
---
And why would you want to hear
a long story about anyone,
---
but especially about me,
because I'm absolutely no one.
---
And just in case you
think I have a bad case
---
of false modesty,
---
after all, I'm standing here,
---
about to launch into the
beginning of my story,
---
there must be something
special about the woman.
---
Just in case you think
I'm underselling myself
---
on some sort of charm offensive.
---
I'm an unmarried school librarian
---
in a small town outside of Nottingham.
---
I'm a Virgo and I'm allergic to shellfish.
---
That's got you, hasn't it?
---
Suddenly your ears prick up.
---
I had a relationship with
a postman for three years
---
until he "let me go", as he put it.
---
He said it was because
I didn't like his cat,
---
but it was actually
because I don't like latex.
---
Now you're a captive audience.
---
You've been waiting to hear
from me all day, haven't you?
---
You're all sitting at home thinking,
---
if only I could have a
bit of uncompromised time
---
with an expert on Dewey Decimal.
---
Well, to begin at the beginning,
---
and I promise you, there won't
be much middle, so fear not.
---
My mother was Lucinda Charlotte
Tinsley, born in Dorset.
---
My father was Louis Davide
Delamotte, born in Boulogne.
---
I'm bilingual but in all other
ways, I think you'll agree,
---
that I'm not terribly French.
---
My mother held the cultural strings.
---
I was raised all-British, as
she disliked all things French,
---
other than her perfume and my father.
---
I was their only child,
---
and my father was 44 years
old at the time of my birth,
---
so it's just as well I wasn't a boy
---
who liked playing
football but rather a girl
---
who liked curling up on her
father's lap and reading books.

---
My father read to me in French,
---
"Perrault's Fairytales," and
"Les Malheurs de Sophie,"
---
and of course, "Le Petit Prince."
---
"Le Petit Prince," and as you
recall, falls from the sky.
---
And when my father read it to me,
---
I remember very clearly the feeling
---
that although I loved my parents,
---
I wished that I too had
fallen from the sky.
---
Because parents give you history,
---
and even as a child I sensed that history,
---
more than anything else, was
a shackle to your freedom.

---
I have an overdeveloped
sense of injustice.
---
This means that in simply
reading the newspaper
---
at breakfast time, I
take my life in my hands.
---
I can read a simple
story of a man or woman
---
who suffers unfairly,
---
and it will ruin every
competing impulse for happiness
---
until I sleep,
---
and the waves of unconsciousness
---
lap against the fury inside me.
---
Where does it come from, that tiny spark,
---
the spark inside some of us that fires up,
---
that becomes a raging
fire inside our spirits?
---
Because for most people who
feel the spark, they put it out.
---
To feel too much is a burden.
---
It's better to counsel
oneself, that as an individual,
---
we cannot impose change
on an unjust world.
---
We must bear it.
---
That's why so many of
the French went along
---
with the occupation,
because to fight was futile.
---
And I understand this because
it is fundamental, is it not,
---
to the human capacity to
adjust, to be realistic?
---
History is full of the records
of populations who accepted.
---
But not my father.
---
In June of 1940, he listened
to Charles de Gaulle
---
make his address on BBC radio.
---
Is the last word said?
---
Has all hope gone?
---
Is defeat definitive?
---
Well, my father, as he tells
it, leapt up and shouted
---
"No," and he ran off and
joined the French Resistance,
---
the Fer Reseau who risked their lives
---
by diverting freight shipments
---
or destroying long
stretches of railroad track.
---
He was 19 years old.
---
As a young girl, I remember
my father often telling me
---
about blowing up a
railroad bridge near Reims.
---
How he planted explosives
beneath the bridge,
---
how he sat in silence
listening to the wind
---
in the wheat sheafs,
---
imagining it to be the whispering
footfalls of the Germans,
---
and how he was very nearly
killed by the force of the blast.
---
And I would sit by his side
---
and address that remarkable mystery.
---
If my father had died before my birth,
---
would I have existed, and who might I be?
---
Would I have been a Hollywood actress
---
or a gypsy, a Russian,
---
or would I have simply fallen from the sky
---
like Le Petit Prince?
---
(upbeat music)

---
My father was arrested on April 12th 1942,
---
and sent to Le Struthof, the
concentration camp in Alsace.
---
There, he was imprisoned with
other courageous colleagues,
---
as well as the civilians and partisans
---
who fought by their side,
---
but he had gained notoriety
for blowing up the Reims bridge
---
and it wasn't long before the
Germans decided to move him
---
from Struthof to Dachau.
---
In the library I see 19-year old boys
---
with fashionable holes
all over their body,
---
smelling of marijuana, listening to iPods,
---
playing music by singers
calling their women bitches.
---
At the same age, my father
sat in a concentration camp,
---
having blown up a bridge
in defence of his country.
---
Only a few years earlier, he'd been a boy
---
playing hopscotch in the summer dust
---
of the Bois de Boulogne.
---
He told me that the worst thing for him
---
was the thought he'd
never see his dog again,
---
a black three-legged mutt called Napoleon.
---
(gentle music)
---
And when my father told me these stories,
---
I always thought of the
picture of the pilot
---
cuddling Le Petit Prince in the desert.
---
I loved that picture.
---
With the child prince is in his arms
---
and looks astonished
at life on this planet.
---
And the pilot says,
"Well, there, on my star,
---
on my planet, on Earth,
---
was a little prince in need of comforting.
---
I took him in my arms, I rocked him.
---
My father was my pilot.
---
But who was my father's pilot?

---
As my father tells it,
---
he was due to be transported to Dachau
---
on a Friday in May, but on
the day he was to leave,
---
Piaf came to Le Struthof.
---
template: song
TOUT SON ÊTRE EST TENDU 
---
template: song
SON SOUFFLE EST SUSPENDU
---
There are lots of
stories about Edith Piaf,
---
The Little Sparrow, who
better than any other
---
represents France in
the eyes of the world.
---
Piaf could somehow collect
the hearts of any listeners
---
into one diabolically beautiful grasp.
---
Sometimes I'm standing in the supermarket,
---
and I'm contemplating frozen lasagna.
---
I'm thinking, am I feeling
---
just a little bit Italian tonight?
---
And the thought of defrosting it
---
and then watching Midsomer
Murders just about kills me.
---
I'm filled with a sorrow so big,
---
I can't understand why
everyone in the supermarket
---
isn't calling the Emergency Service
---
that deals in sudden incurable sadness.
---
How can someone as invisible
as me carry a feeling
---
the size of the United
States Library of Congress
---
in Washington.
---
My sorrow wouldn't fit in its book-stacks.
---
Well, Piaf symbolized
that peculiar equation,
---
the modesty of a human
body and the immodesty
---
of human suffering.
---
On the weekend she died, Paris
sold 300,000 of her records.
---
Not a copy remained in single store.
---
And during the war, Piaf often
performed at social events
---
for the German Forces.
---
She would appear at the One Two Two club
---
and sing for high-ranking
German officials.
---
They sat at their tables,
---
swilling beer and she stood
in the light and sang.

---
Because of these performances,
---
she was allowed to visit
French prisoners in the camps
---
to boost their morale.
---
There have long been rumors
---
that sometimes she would
pose for photographs
---
with the prisoners, then have
the photographs developed,
---
then have new passports forged
---
which she gave to the
prisoners on her return.
---
That night in Le Struthof,
she sang in the dining hall,
---
a tiny figure in trademark black,
---
surrounded by her musicians.
---
She was 28 years old.

---
The prisoners exploded
into rapturous applause,
---
and surged forward, surrounding her.
---
She was so tiny, she was like a child
---
lost in a crowded railway station.
---
It was chaos.
---
The German guards were trying
to pull her out of the crowd
---
and away to the waiting vehicles.
---
And with nothing to lose,
---
my father pushed through the throng.
---
She disappeared through a
door at the back of the hall
---
and into a dark corridor.
---
There were members of her
musical troupe around her,
---
carrying their instruments.
---
My father slipped through the
door and into the darkness.
---
He locked eyes with her.
---
M'aidez.
---
Edith grabbed a violin
from one of her musicians.
---
He handed my father his overcoat.
---
Another one handed him a scarf.
---
Edith thrust the violin at him.
---
The German guards were pushing them
---
towards the waiting cars.
---
Edith grabbed him and
pulled him after her.
---
The musicians filled the three cars,
---
Edith and my father in the first one.
---
The car doors slammed, nobody spoke.
---
The cars began to move.
---
The camp gates opened.
---
The cars passed through.
---
My father was in a car
with The Little Sparrow.
---
He was free.

And the Rue Crespin de
Gast in Menilmontant,
---
is the Musee Edith Piaf,
---
it's a tiny archive in an apartment
---
up four flights of stairs.
---
And the entrance is free to the two rooms,
---
and as you wander around
to the crackling recording,
---
you will see a cardboard cut-out of Edith
---
in her customary black
dress next to a stuffed bear
---
that was a gift from her second husband.
---
And there are letters from Chevalier
---
and Montand and Dietrich and Cocteau,
---
and it somehow smells of
L'Heure Attendue by Jean Patou,
---
it's my mother's perfume.
---
I go to the Museum every
other year on my birthday.
---
I go first class on the
Eurostar as a treat,
---
and stay in a rather nice little
three star in Montparnasse.

Although this year marks my 12th visit,

the proprietor never
engages me in conversation,

and does not know that I represent,
---
in my every breath, a touching
legacy of the Little Sparrow.

Le Petit Prince advised the pilot,
---
"It's good to look at the sky at night.
---
All the stars are in bloom."
---
In 1982, Lydumila Georgievna Karachkina,

a Soviet astronomer, named
a small star for Piaf.

Sometimes, when the night is very dark,

## TOO JUNIOR JONES:
Three times I saw her, three times.
---
It was 1947, and I was spending my life
---
in the hallowed halls
of The New York Times,
---
dreaming about being the kind of writer
---
that made other writers
wanna write better.
---
I'd spent two years on the fashion pages,
---
and they still hadn't sent me to Paris.
---
Too junior, just 21 years old,
---
that's practically middle-aged,
---
I was still too junior, right.
---
That was how I got my nickname.
---
Fridays, me and the sports guys
---
would go share a Lucky Strike
---
and coffee down at the Automat,
---
and chew the fat about
some of the lame brains
---
in the office.
---
Ricky Reynolds started it,
---
lending me a nickel to get
a piece of pie, he goes,
---
"Well, there you go, Too
Junior," and the name stuck.
---
Too Junior Jones,
---
although my mother still
called me Gwendoline.
---
Pretty soon, I was gonna go
from too junior to too senior
---
with nothing in the middle
to show for my talents.
---
I wanted to be a writer.
---
I wanted to be a serious writer
writing about serious things
---
in a serious world.
---
I wanted to put the high in falutin'.
---
And I wanted to write elegant commentaries
---
about life and art and specialize
in surprising syntaxes,
---
in elevated thoughts,
---
peppering my pieces with
the kind of insights
---
that would make a reader
put their coffee mug down
---
on the table and say, "Holy
Cow, that dame can write."
---
And I wanted to compose
articles with style and beauty
---
and charisma so that the Pulitzer
Prize guys would observe,
---
this little tootsie is the
Rita Hayworth of Print.
---
I wanted important people to say,
---
it reminds me of that
line by Scott Fitzgerald,
---
oh, no, no, no, or was
it Too Junior Jones?
---
It was now or never.
---
I couldn't sit around and
wait for an opportunity
---
to come up and tap me on the shoulder.
---
No, I had to make an opportunity.
---
So I got to the boss and
I begged, and I pleaded,
---
and yes, I even cried a
couple of phony tears,
---
Boss looks at me, he says,
---
"Get your derriere over to that Olivetti
---
and stop yapping, start tapping."
---
Well, I took a deep breath and I said,
---
"Please, please boss,
give me something to do
---
that I can sink my teeth into."
---
The boss wasn't a stupid guy.
---
You can't be stupid running
the newspaper of record,
---
but you can be a pain in the ass,
---
and he hummed and he hahed.
---
And he leant back in his chair,
---
and put his feet up on the desk.
---
He fiddled around tapping
a Camel out of the packet,
---
and took his time lighting it.
---
Finally he says, "A profile, 800 words."
---
And I thought hell, in
for a penny and I said,
---
"Do not under any circumstances
give me Dinah Washington
---
or Paulette Goddard or some other dame
---
who's just gonna talk about
fame and riches or Lux soap,
---
or what have you.
---
Give me something meaty."
---
Well, right at that moment the arts editor
---
was passing by the boss's doorway.
---
Terry Doyle, a nobody with the
imagination of a paper clip.
---
Now, boss calls him in, and
he comes in, and boss says,
---
"Who's on?
---
What's happening?
---
What's the hoi polloi talking about?"
---
Terry the Paperclip said,
"Mel Torme and the Mel- tones
---
are playing Wednesday."
---
The Velvet Fog.
---
I'd spent years listening to him
---
on my Ma's favorite radio station.
---
My boss looked at me, I shook my head,
---
though where I got the
gumption I will never know.
---
Then Paperclip says,
---
"Holiday's singin' at the
Three Deuces on Thursday"
---
when I looked right at
the Boss and I nodded.
---
Boss said, "800 words by Saturday,
---
if it's any good, you've
got yourself a new job,
---
if it's no good, you're
back on hem-lines."
---
In those days, you didn't
see people on the television.
---
You heard them on recordings, or in clubs.
---
I didn't know a single person
who owned a television set.
---
When the World Series final was on TV,
---
three million people watched it,
---
but almost all of them from
inside department stores
---
walking the store-windows.
---
My pal Ginger even had to write a story
---
about how the stores were letting people
---
just prop their lawn-chairs
on the side-walk,
---
and it was good for business.
---
So I hadn't seen Billie
Holiday too many times.
---
But I knew all the stories,
---
now the drug addiction, the booze.
---
She was a jazz singer and a Negro.
---
it doesn't get much tougher than that.
---
I was meeting her in the
bar of the Hotel Braddock,
---
and when I get there,
---
she's sitting at the
bar, drinking a scotch,
---
and there is a very large dog at her feet.
---
She is bigger than I'd pictured,
---
and she smelled heavily of perfume,
---
a kind of heady mixture that
was one part New Orleans
---
and two parts Marrakech.

---
The lamps hung low over the bar.
---
"Miss Holiday," Well, she
looked at me but said nothing.
---
There was music playing
and a couple of skinny guys
---
sitting close by.
---
"Miss Holiday, I'm from The Times."
---
"Miss Holiday, is it okay if I ask you
---
a couple of questions?"
---
This great big silence
had descended over us.
---
It drowned out the
tinkling of the bar music,
---
the low hubbub from the booth seats.
---
It was the biggest, longest
silence I ever heard.
---
It was a silence that seemed
to stretch into the future
---
until the very point that a
preacher intoned over my coffin.
---
We are here to bid farewell
to Too Junior Jones.
---
Let it be noted that no
one wrote about brassieres
---
the way she did.

---
I was always gonna be the
kind of person that by rights
---
should have mastered life.
---
I had a certain kind of talent,
---
I had curiosity, and I could write,
---
then that was for sure,
---
but I was also the kind of person
---
who was always missing out on good fortune
---
by some kind of completely
random mischance.
---
I should have got the
scholarship to Vassar
---
but I got chicken pox on the
morning of the examination.
---
I should have married
Larry Travis, my prom date,
---
who's now head of one of the richest
---
pharmaceutical companies in America,
---
only when he asked me,
he was chewing a steak
---
with his mouth open.

---
And I decided I couldn't
sit across from him
---
for the next 40 years
looking at his molars.
---
If he'd asked me sipping a
soda instead of eating a steak,
---
I'd have been Mrs Larry Travis
---
in the rest would be history.
---
So the fact that I had to
write 800 scintillating words
---
on a woman who may have been the greatest
---
jazz singer of life, but who
couldn't, well, wouldn't talk,
---
that made absolute perfect sense.
---
I tried again,
---
"Miss Holiday, it's a real privilege
---
to get a chance to talk with you.
---
That you're just about my favorite singer.
---
I'll never forget the first
time I heard, 'Strange Fruit'."
---
She recorded "Strange
Fruit" on a different label,
---
the Commodore Arts, because
Columbia, wouldn't do it.
---
Radio stations banned the song.
---
And you gotta remember,
---
the top selling albums around that time
---
were Perry Como's Merry Christmas Music,
---
and Guy Lombardo's Lombardoland.
---
Her voice reminded me
think of thick, blue ink.

Something hazy and lazy
played in the background,

and the whole while my
future was slipping away

into the haze of cigarette smoke.

I would not ever be a real writer.

I would never amount to anything.

I had a sudden need to
rush out and hale a cab
---
for the Brooklyn Bridge,
---
where, after chatting quite
convivially with the driver,
---
I would climb the
balustrade in my MaryJanes,
---
and hurl myself into the
putrid tides of the East River.
---
No one would say, now
that Too Junior's gone,
---
I can't bring myself to read
about Tweeds for Spring.
---
Ricky Reynolds probably pass
the hat for a bunch of dahlias,
---
but the presses would keep on rolling.
---
And suddenly, I got mad.
---
If things happened to other
people, why not to me?
---
Was I sitting around
waiting for a telegram
---
from the Gods of Chance saying, oh, sorry,
---
made a mistake, stop.
---
Realize you are supposed
to be a hotshot, stop.
---
Change of fortune coming your way, stop.
---
I thought to myself, you pull
yourself together, honey,
---
and you show the world that
when circumstances conspire
---
to land a punch, you get
right back up in the ring.
---
And Miss Holiday, if you
don't wanna talk to me,
---
that makes perfect sense because
every part of your history
---
is right there in your voice.
---
And nothing you say to any reporter
---
is gonna say more than your songs do.
---
And it's not your problem
---
that an interview involves
talking and taking notes,
---
as in you talking and me taking notes,
---
but that's what an interview comprises,
---
that is not your problem.
---
And it's certainly not your problem
---
that if I don't get
this interview with you,
---
I will never get off the
goddamn fashion pages,
---
I'll be writing about goddamn box pleats
---
until I drop dead of boredom,
---
never having done a thing of
note or heading with a life.
---
And I noted she was staring at me.
---
You're kinda bit young
to be out in the world
---
talking to people, ain't you?
---
And I said, "Well, I know I look 19 but I'm actually 62."
---
"I just avoid strong sun and
bad men, if I can help it."
---
And she laughed a throaty
laugh and then she talked.
---
We talked about taking the name Billie
---
from the screen star Billie Dove,
---
'cause it sounded smokier than Eleanora.
---
And we talked about getting discovered
---
and Benny Goodman and Count Basie,
---
and how it was to be the
first black woman to sing
---
with a white orchestra.
---
We talked about Lester Young
who called her Lady Day,
---
and how she called him Prez,
because he was the best.
---
I told her my nickname was Too Junior.
---
And she said,
---
"I can see why you're
not a jazz singer, then."
---
I said, "You seem to have
been young for everything.
---
Has that caused you problems?"
---
Billie was only 20 years old
---
when the jazz producer, John Hammond,
---
declared her the greatest
voice he'd ever heard.
---
She did everything too soon.
---
She grew up too soon,
she got famous too soon,
---
she got ruined too soon
and she died too soon.
---
"Nothing hasn't caused me problems.
---
My life's been one big problem.
---
But hell, Too Junior, what
do happy people sing about?"

July 17 1959, just sitting on
my desk talking to Annie Faber
---
about something we'd both
seen on TV the last night,
---
some dumb contestant on
Uncle Jim's Spelling Bee,
---
or Missus Goes a Shopping,
somebody yelled out,
---
I don't know who to,
---
or if it was just to the world in general,
---
that Billie Holiday had died.
---
She had been getting
busted for heroin addiction
---
and arrested fairly constantly,
---
and eventually she was
denied a license to perform
---
in any establishment selling booze.
---
Which was kind of a disaster
because jazz and booze
---
go together like a horse and cart
---
or Billie Holiday and white gardenias.
---
The news stories of her
decline had been appearing
---
since I interviewed her.
---
And by the by, the profile was excellent,
---
if I say so myself

---
and I got a senior position
writing for features.
---
I was at her last concert
at the Phoenix Theatre
---
on 2nd Avenue.
---
And for her encore, she sang,
---
"It Ain't Nobody's Business If I Do."
---
And it wasn't.
---
Boss sent me to cover the funeral,
---
but I would have gone anyway.
---
There were more than 3,000 people there
---
at St Paul the Apostle Church,
---
a thousand of them spilling
over the sidewalks.
---
Benny Goodman was there, Buddy Rogers.
---
The clarinetist Tony Scott later wrote,
---
"The graspers and rejectors
were there by the carload,
---
all heads bowed and solemn-looking,
---
counting the attendance or the minutes
---
until normal business could continue."
---
Was I a grasper?
---
Was I grasping for a
version of Billie Holiday
---
that could fill a couple of
columns in The New York Times
---
and garner me a promotion?
---
Maybe I was.
---
Was it the white powder that killed her?
---
I don't know.
---
What I do know is she flew
over the top of the rest of us,
---
the frightened ones,
---
the ones scared of the parts of ourselves
---
that do not fit easily
into this dull place.
---
We can praise those who try to escape.
---
We can stand on the sidelines,
write our feature articles
---
and buy their records
as though we honor them,
---
but underneath it all,
---
we don't like those who
refuse to remain earthbound.
---
They frighten us.
---
Their freedom reminds us
of our own little prisons.
---
And in the end, people like that,
---
they got no place to go but trouble,
---
'cause trouble is the only
place that welcomes them.
---
I don't know.
---
I truly don't know how
to put it into words.
---
Which is strange for me.

(suspenseful music)
---
The idea was I'd be doing the deck quoits
---
and the board games and the
snorkeling with the little ones
---
while the rich and famous
---
got on with the scintillating
chitchat and the cocktails.
---
And there were cocktails, let me tell you.
---
Now, the lady I had the meeting with,
---
I suppose she was a personal assistant,
---
said it was a big boat.
---
Add to that, the offer of
four times my usual salary,
---
and the fact that I had just
broken up with Sean Ferguson,
---
that evil one-eyed bastard
who told Sinead O'Rowe
---
I was too flat-chested to marry,
---
and I wanted to get as far
away from County Wicklow
---
as I possibly could.
---
All right, he wasn't
one-eyed, but he was evil.
---
And my mom said to me
he wasn't to be trusted,
---
and he'd never make me happy
---
but tell that to an 18-year
old, you may as well say,
---
get naked post haste
---
so he can have his perverted
erotic way with you,
---
'cause all any 18-year old
wants is to have wild sex
---
with a man her mother thinks is no good.
---
She was right in the end.
---
Always are, aren't they?
---
You spend all those years
saying, "Mom, you're wrong,
---
you're a control freak.
---
I'm different to you,
let me live my own life."
---
And then one day, at about
---
she was right, the old Battleaxe!
---
I should never have pierced my ears,
---
we should never have chucked in French,
---
I should never have worn
that thigh skimming dress
---
in horizontal stripes,
---
and I should never have let Sean Ferguson
---
have his way with me, upside
down and back to front.
---
Anyhow, I wanted to get away
from him, and to be honest,
---
I had the thought that
I was young and free,
---
and should be trying things
---
that possibly wouldn't come my way
---
when I was 47, 180 pounds
and living in a flat
---
with a parrot.
---
I took the job.
---
"A big boat," she said, the hiring lady,
---
and she weren't lying.
---
No sardine can.
---
325 feet, to be exact, and more marble than most cathedrals.
---
18 state rooms, 40 staff, lapis lazuli fireplaces,
---
and a swimming pool with
an inlaid mosaic flooring 
---
copied from the Palace
of Knossos in Crete.
---
Not too shabby.
---
But 325 feet or no, I spent
a fair bit of the cruise
---
heaving into the jacks.
---
I was 19 years old from the country.
---
What can I say?
---
Nobody told me the sea moved.
---
So, how was he?
---
And that's what everyone asks me.
---
They all want to know how he was, firstly.
---
Well, he was pig ugly if you want to know,
---
but there wasn't a woman alive
---
who wouldn't have lain down
in the trough with him.
---
What do you call that?
---
It's not looks clearly or even
charm, though he had that.
---
It wasn't the money,
although that always helps.
---
It was the way he looked at you.
---
It's that carnal instinct
---
that makes a man look at a woman,
---
and measure, at first glance,
her sexual desirability.
---
He looked at you, and yes,
actually, he did look at me,
---
quite often, actually,
and for just a second,
---
despite the grandiose surroundings
or the liveried staff,
---
or the fact that you couldn't
tell if it was the ice cubes
---
or the diamonds that were tinkling.
---
Despite all that, he reminded
you that we're animals.
---
I'd seen her in the magazines,
---
of course, I had, who hadn't?
---
All that yelling at people and hijinks,
---
well, elevated her from
being more than a voice,
---
she was a celebrity.
And that was in the day
---
when it took more than glamorous
liaisons with playboys,
---
or strapless Mainbocher evening gowns,
---
to garner celebrity status.
---
It took, shocking though it
may be to modern ears, talent.
---
Outsized talent, the talent
for imagination, or elegance,
---
or beauty, or wit.
---
She was wearing a pair of Capri pants
---
and what we called a diaphanous blouse,
---
and very large sunglasses
---
because in those days,
---
if you didn't wear very large sunglasses,
---
you weren't anyone to anyone.
---
Her hair was coiffed and she
had those interesting eyebrows,
---
Joan Crawford had eyebrows.
---
They are sexy eyebrows,
they were so dark and hairy,
---
they made you wonder about somewhere else.
---
So you put the confidence
of those dark looks
---
which were not beautiful but interesting,
---
once you put the confidence
of those looks together
---
with those massive vocal
chords, she was dazzling.
---
So when she walked up the
gang plank and onto the deck
---
with her anxious looking
husband, Meninghini,
---
on day one of the Cruise from Hell,
---
Tina Onassis gave her the once over.
---
Looks at her like this.
---
Registering trouble because
she was used to trouble.
---
Because like most women,
---
she wanted the one
thing she couldn't have,
---
which is certainty.
---
No marriage certificate in
the world gives you that,
---
because men are what men are.
---
Who's arguing?

---
Also on board were Ari's sister Artemis
---
and her hubby I called The Prof,
---
Professor Theodore Garofalides,
---
also Gianni Agnelli of the Fiat fame,
---
and his wife Princess Marella,
---
who looked like a very
expensive race-horse.
---
So it was all very lawdy daw.
---
Now, who am I forgetting?
---
Is there someone else?
---
Oh, Winston Churchill and Lady C.,
---
neither of whom looked like they were up
---
for doing the Rhumba or playing Sardines,
---
as they were both approaching 197.
---
Quite a little guest list.
---
Think Cluedo at 23 knots, with
more sex and fewer murders.
---
So picture this, my two
little charges faffin around,
---
steering the yacht with
the Captain, laughing,
---
and me standing with them watching Winston
---
struggle to chuck a deck quoit,
---
trying to imagine this old geezer saying,
---
"We shall fight on the beaches,
we shall never surrender."
---
Princess Long-Face
sited on the deck chair,
---
just reading a Harpers Bazaar
interview with Charlton Heston
---
about the making of Ben Hur,
---
saying, "I just really can't
imagine Charlton Heston
---
as a Jew."

---
Artemis and the Prof playing Scrabble,
---
and Tina, the neglected
wife and Meneghini,
---
the forsaken husband, sulking furiously
---
while Mr Onassis, a man
who felt no obligation
---
to hide a thing, strolled
the decks hand in hand
---
with Maria Callas.
---
And that was it,
---
the start of a story that
captivated the world.
---
Only I never appear in the story.
---
I'm a character, invisible,
unwritten, unremembered.
---
There are no photos of me
in historical archives.
---
But I am on the deck of the Christina.
---
I am there against the railings,
---
against the backdrop of glinting blue,
---
a small breeze disheveling
my ginger curls.
---
Oh, just a little nothing
thing in a cheap sun dress
---
from Michael Guineys.
---
I'm somewhere between
childhood and adulthood,
---
just hovering there, suspended
in a single summer evening,
---
while the giant sun sinking
below the horizon line
---
sends out the final glorious
farewell to the day.
---
I'm Orla McDonagh chasing
a touch of splendour
---
in Elizabeth Arden's
Radiant Peony lipstick,
---
and I'm watching Ari
Onassis and Maria Callas
---
ruin their marriages

---
and sail headlong into a
future of scandal, and fame,
---
and flashbulbs, of dead
presidents and first ladies,
---
of plane crashes and
flirtations and breakups,
---
and betrayals, and loss, and
death, and longing, and money,
---
two glittering stars in the firmament
---
of the 20th century.
---
I am standing there,
---
my shadow, gradually
capitulating to the darkness.
---
Below deck, the children
are asleep in their bunks.
---
At the boat's stern, Tina
and her sister in law
---
are puffing elegantly on Dunhill Slims
---
as Artemis attempts to console Tina
---
that Ari will tire of Callas
as he tires of everything.
---
Lady C. and Winston are taking refuge
---
from the volatile climate
of on-board romance,
---
they are hiding, petrified
and frail, in their cabins.
---
And the stewards stride
the deck muttering gossip,
---
that the cuckolded Meninghini
---
is demanding an end to the cruise
---
but that Onassis refuses to
turn back to Monte Carlo.
---
I'm the witness there, back to the wind.
---
I'm appearing to be busy holding
down the folds of my dress,
---
but I'm listening, listening and watching.
---
And it's dawning on me at the same rate
---
that the light diffuses over
the silky Mediterranean,
---
that I might leave this job
just a little more worldly wise
---
than when I started it.
---
I make up my mind to go to bed early.
---
I'm flah'ed out by the sturm
and drung, to be honest.
---
In the distance, the women's cigarettes
---
look like fire-flies.
---
Their murmuring voices float single words
---
towards me on the breeze.
---
I say Buona Notte to the first mate,
---
feeling a tiny bit cosmopolitan,
and I descend the stairs.
---
But I walk past their cabin
and I hear furious noise,
---
screams and china breaking against walls.
---
Meninghini is going off his nut at Callas,
---
saying, I'ma fly back
from the nearest airport.
---
The lights are dim,
---
and I hear my name called,
---
and I turn to see Mr Onassis
standing in the doorway
---
of the salon.
---
"Orla," he says, "I want to talk to you."
---
I have never been in the bar-room before.
---
A lamp is on but the room is shadowy.
---
I wonder if he's about
to give me a bollocking,
---
but he looks calm, golden, rich.
---
He sits on a stool which
Alexander had told me,
---
giggling, was made from
a whale's foreskin.
---
The bar is crafted from
timbers of a Spanish galleon,
---
and edged in sailing rope and lit up,
---
beneath its glass surface
---
to reveal a relief of the
sea with small model ships,
---
moved by magnets.
---
"Orla," he growls,
---
"Tell me what you want."
---
His eyes were running down
me like dripping honey.
---
"Oh, I'm very happy
thank you, Mr Onassis".
---
He bids me closer, "Tell
me, what you want".
---
Well, he asked.
---
"I want a rich husband and a poor lover,
---
and a chauffeur and a Cadillac Fleetwood.
---
I'd like a castle and small white dog,
---
and an apartment in New York
City with interesting friends
---
who talk too much and stay out too late."
---
He smiled, reached out
and pushed a curl aside.
---
"Orla, let me give you those things".
---
"Mr Onassis, I'm a nanny." (chuckles)
---
"I'm making you an offer, Nanny".
---
"And what about your wife, Mr Onassis?"
---
"The marriage is over, Orla".
---
"And what about the singer, Mr Onassis?"
---
The yacht was quiet.
---
The guests were all in their state rooms.
---
Up on deck, I could just
make out the tipsy laughs
---
of some of the crew, playing Five Hundred.
---
I looked at him.
---
The pitted face, the hooded eyes,
---
that brutal charge of entitlement.
---
The vulgar infamy that was,
---
and has always been so much more erotic
---
to women than elegance.
---
Ask anyone whose life is spent tending
---
to the whims of others,
---
ask anyone who mends a
coat or attends a lavatory,
---
or who ushers you to your
seat in an auditorium,
---
someone who lends you a book in a library,
---
anyone who answers to others,
---
older, richer, more powerful.
---
Ask them and they will
confess, eventually,
---
that in quiet moments, the
question asserts itself
---
like a small, annoying itch.
---
Who might I be, if I were somebody?
---
And they dance before me,
---
the beckoning images
that might just forever
---
illustrate the moment
an ordinary life turned.
---
Dior shirtwaisters, Cartier watches,
---
a man who wanted to devour me,
---
Orla O, had a ring to it.

---
And then suddenly, coming
out of the depths of night
---
and stillness and unclaimed possibility,
---
came a sound that clipped the wings
---
of any other woman's flight of
fancy with ferocious beauty.
---
There was nothing to do but surrender.
---
(gentle music)
---
(singing in foreign language)
