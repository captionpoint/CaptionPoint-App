by Joshua Allen

---
## &nbsp;
Good evening everyone. Hello, thank you.
---
## &nbsp;
Oh, thank you!
---
## &nbsp;
My name is Markie Gray,
---
## &nbsp;
I'm the Managing Director
here at Raven Theatre.
---
## &nbsp;
Just a few housekeeping
things before we get started,
---
## &nbsp;
please silence your cell phones.
---
## &nbsp;
If they go off during the performance,
---
## &nbsp;
it really disrupts the actors.
---
## &nbsp;
And please, at Raven we ask
that you keep your mask on
---
## &nbsp;
for the duration of the performance,
---
## &nbsp;
as well as the whole time
that you're in the facility.
---
## &nbsp;
Thank you so much for
helping keep everyone safe.
---
## &nbsp;
We here at Raven, we
love reactions to shows.
---
## &nbsp;
If something on stage
makes you laugh, laugh.
---
## &nbsp;
If something makes you cry, cry.
---
## &nbsp;
Please react in whatever
way feels good to you.
---
## &nbsp;
Our actors love it, they feed off of it.
---
## &nbsp;
We really encourage it here.
---
## &nbsp;
How many people here are subscribers?
---
## &nbsp;
Ooh, look at all these
subscribers, that's fantastic.
---
## &nbsp;
If you are not a subscriber,
---
## &nbsp;
but you would like to become one
---
## &nbsp;
after seeing the show tonight,
---
## &nbsp;
you can visit our box office
at intermission or after the
---
## &nbsp;
show and upgrade your
ticket to a subscription.
---
## &nbsp;
You can come back and
see our entire season.
---
## &nbsp;
We'd love to see you again.
---
## &nbsp;
And finally, we are a nonprofit,
---
## &nbsp;
which means in order to
make shows like these,
---
## &nbsp;
we rely on donations from folks like you.
---
## &nbsp;
We're in the middle of a
campaign to raise $30,000
---
## &nbsp;
By the end of the year.
---
## &nbsp;
As you exit the theater, you'll
see a little donation box
---
## &nbsp;
and you can also donate online.
---
## &nbsp;
Anything you can give helps.
---
## &nbsp;
If you're moved by what you see on stage,
---
## &nbsp;
your dollars can directly contribute
---
## &nbsp;
to helping us make more of it.
---
## &nbsp;
So thank you so much.
---
## &nbsp;
And please, enjoy the
_The Last Pair of Earlies_.

Ready?
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
Yeah.
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
Now. Early's Shoe Palace! laughs
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
What you think?
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
That ain't how you spell "palace".
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
Yes, it is.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
No, it aint.
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
Yes, it is.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
I'm tellin ya, "palace"

## YOUNG WAYLAND:

## YOUNG DELLA:
But you can turn that "I" into an "A"
---
## &nbsp;
if you're real careful.
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:

---
## YOUNG DELLA:

---
## &nbsp;
But I didn't want you to put that sign up
---
## &nbsp;

young Della chuckles
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
Two more weeks, all my
inventory gonna be done.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
Just make sure you don't
end up on Henry's bad side.
---
## &nbsp;
He gave you a good deal
on all that good leather.
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
Henry and I got an understanding.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
Well Wayland, you got to be ready.
---
## &nbsp;
Folks in Sunflower County
ain't gonna take too kindly
---
## &nbsp;
to you just up and trying
to steal their customers.
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
I aint worried about that.
---
## &nbsp;
They might have customers,
but not for long,
---
## &nbsp;
because I got passion. And I'm smarter.
---
## &nbsp;
'Cause I understand what a
pair of shoes mean to somebody.
---
## &nbsp;
They ain't just somethin' you
wear to get you from A to B.
---
## &nbsp;
They hold you up, carry your weight,
---
## &nbsp;
and they don't never ask
you for nothin' in return.
---
## &nbsp;
My mama used to work for a white
man named Hiram Greenfield,
---
## &nbsp;
who used to make shoes for people.
---
## &nbsp;
And I would just sit up under him
---
## &nbsp;
and watch him measure folks.
---
## &nbsp;
Their ankle, their toe,
the ball of their foot.
---
## &nbsp;
I seen a man come in the door barefoot
---
## &nbsp;
and walk out with a new pair of shoes on,
---
## &nbsp;
and it's like he just won a million bucks.
---
## &nbsp;
young Wayland laughs
---
## &nbsp;
Mama worked in his
house, cookin' his food,
---
## &nbsp;
scrubbin' his floors, doin' the wash.
---
## &nbsp;
He used to pay her
seventy-five cents a day.
---
## &nbsp;
Whew, we felt so rich!
---
## &nbsp;
But we couldn't go home
'til he inspected his floor
---
## &nbsp;
to his satisfaction. He
wanted that floor so clean
---
## &nbsp;
he could see hisself in it.
---
## &nbsp;
We standin' over here by
the door, waitin' to go,
---
## &nbsp;
and he walkin' around, real slow like,
---
## &nbsp;
lookin' at the floorboards,
takin' his time.
---
## &nbsp;
And all I can hear is
click, clack. Click, clack.
---
## &nbsp;
His shoes hittin' the floor making music.
---
## &nbsp;
Click, clack. Like fanfare for the king.
---
## &nbsp;
young Wayland laughs
---
## &nbsp;
In them shoes he was the king
of that house and he knew it.
---
## &nbsp;
Click. Clack. His shoes made noise.
---
## &nbsp;
People heard him comin'!
---
## &nbsp;
I wanna do that for our people.
---
## &nbsp;
All us colored folk, we
all descended from kings,
---
## &nbsp;
and it's high time we
started feelin' like kings,
---
## &nbsp;
even if we can't act like 'em.
---
## &nbsp;
And if a little bit of
leather and wood will do that,
---
## &nbsp;
then hell, I got the
luckiest job in the world.
---
## &nbsp;
I'll make a king outta any man.
---
## &nbsp;
And I'm startin' with our boy.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
Those are for the baby?
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
You bet they are.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
I wanna help.
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
Alright, come here.
---
## &nbsp;
Now, I'm fixin' to put the tacs in.
---
## &nbsp;
You just hammer 'em in, all right?
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
Where?
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
I'll show ya,
---
## &nbsp;
and then we're gonna make
sure the toe is crimped.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
What that mean?
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
I'll show you. Ready?
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
Ready.
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
All right, put the tac in right there.

## YOUNG WAYLAND:

This is just the beginning.
---
## &nbsp;

Clarksdale, Jackson.
---
## &nbsp;
You won't find a square
inch of Mississippi
---
## &nbsp;
that ain't been walked over
in a Wayland Early shoe.
---
## &nbsp;
We gonna take over the whole state.

young Wayland laughs
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
You better do some exercises,
---
## &nbsp;
make sure your ears is nice and strong
---
## &nbsp;
'cause you gonna have some
heavy diamonds hanging from 'em.
---

young Wayland laughs
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
And we gonna go to parties and
you gonna turn around and see
---
## &nbsp;
W.C. Handy. Perry Bradford. Mamie Smith.
---
## &nbsp;
And you gonna say,
---
## &nbsp;
"Mamie, darling, what a lovely fur.
---
## &nbsp;
Is it from Paris?
---
## &nbsp;
You know what would just be
divine with that fur, darling?
---
## &nbsp;
A pair of my husband's custom-made shoes."

young Wayland laughs

## YOUNG WAYLAND:
That's our life. So get ready for it.
---
## &nbsp;
My dreams is so big,

## &nbsp;
it's gonna take my heart
and yours to hold 'em all.

## JIMMY:
Just how lazy is a bag of nickels?
---
## &nbsp;
Is it lazier than a bucket of staples?

## DELLA:

---
## JIMMY:
Ah, now you ain't still mad

## DELLA:

---
template: noise
Della chuckles
---
## DELLA:
Imagine me with all those
heathens down at the DeLisa.
---
## &nbsp;
All that whiskey and sweat and desperation
---
## &nbsp;
clogging my nostrils.
---
## &nbsp;
A gaggle of sinners rubbing
up against each other,
---
## &nbsp;
hoping to find somebody
drunk enough to take home
---
## &nbsp;
but not too drunk to take advantage of.
---
## &nbsp;
No thank you.
---
## JIMMY:
I'm goin'.
---
## DELLA:
Oh.
---
## JIMMY:
Is that what you think
of me? Whiskey and sweat?
---
## &nbsp;
And desperation?
---
## DELLA:
No, I just, I just,
now I feel like an ass.
---
template: noise
Jimmy chuckles
---
## JIMMY:
I'm just teasing you. But you should go.
---
## &nbsp;
If you like Albert Ammons.
---
## &nbsp;
It ain't near as bad as you think.
---
## &nbsp;
You ever been to the DeLisa?
---
## DELLA:
No.
---
## JIMMY:
Then how you know it's that bad?
---
## DELLA:
I just never know
decent people to go there.
---
## JIMMY:
It ain't the den of
iniquity you think it is.
---
## &nbsp;
Besides, it's air conditioned.
---
## DELLA:
Well, I guess I can't
blame nobody for going then.
---
## JIMMY:
Yeah. It look like
summer came early, huh?
---
## &nbsp;
Why you keep looking out the window?
---
## &nbsp;
Something happening out there?
---
## DELLA:
Huh? Oh, no. I didn't
even know I was doin' that.
---
## JIMMY:
Is everything all right?
---
## DELLA:
Yeah, everything's fine, actually.

## &nbsp;
I got a good feeling about today.

## JIMMY:
Any reason in particular?

---
## &nbsp;
Oh. Good morning, Jimmy.

## JIMMY:

---
## MYRNA:
Well Della, I just came by

---
## &nbsp;

but I can come by later.
---
## JIMMY:
No, um, actually I better be going.

## &nbsp;
I'll just leave your change here.
---
## DELLA:

---
## JIMMY:
Sorry again about the eggs.

You're married, not dead.
---
## &nbsp;
Is it April or August

---
## DELLA:

---
## MYRNA:
Della, look.
---
## DELLA:
Is he here?
---
## MYRNA:
Charlie Robinson, as I live and breathe.
---
## DELLA:
Oh.
---
## MYRNA:
Walking down the street,
in the middle of a heat wave,
---
## &nbsp;
wearing a mink coat. What
kinda sense do that make?
---
## &nbsp;
She think she slick.
---
## &nbsp;
She showing off so everybody know
---
## &nbsp;
Barnett bought her that fur.
---
## &nbsp;
Looking like a damn raccoon.
---
## &nbsp;
I hope she get heat stroke
---
## &nbsp;
and fall out in the middle of traffic.
---
## DELLA:
Oh, take that back.
---
## MYRNA:
I will not. You know what,
though? I hope they happy.
---
## &nbsp;
They deserve each other.
I heard she got the clap.
---
## &nbsp;
Yeah, I'm talking about
you! Go kick rocks!
---
## DELLA:
Quit that hollering!
What if she come up here?
---
## MYRNA:
She act all big and bad
but I got something for her.
---
## &nbsp;
I'll take her down like Joe
Louis took down that Nazi boy.
---
## &nbsp;
Only I won't need the whole two minutes.
---
## DELLA:
Girl, you know Charlene
Robinson ain't worth all that.
---
## MYRNA:
You right. You right.
---
## &nbsp;
That's why I ain't studying no more men.
---
## &nbsp;
Who you think I saw?
---
## DELLA:
When?
---
## MYRNA:
When I called you over to the window.
---
## &nbsp;
You asked me if he was here. He who?
---
## DELLA:
Nobody.
---
## MYRNA:
Della.
---
## DELLA:
I said nobody. How's your daddy?
---
## MYRNA:
Nurses said he was feeling mighty down,
---
## &nbsp;
but he sprang up soon as I walked in
---
## &nbsp;
with one of your cherry pies.
---
## &nbsp;
Man can't hardly
recognize his own daughter
---
## &nbsp;
but he can smell pie from
Detroit. Which reminds me.
---
## &nbsp;
This for them two other
pies from last week too.
---
## DELLA:
You hand everybody money
outta your underwear?
---
## MYRNA:
You want it or not?
---
## DELLA:
It's sweaty.
---
## MYRNA:
You'd be sweaty too, you
ever bothered to step outside.
---
## &nbsp;
You do remember outside, right?
---
## &nbsp;
Just like inside, but bigger.
---
## DELLA:
Yeah, I don't know how I
keep from going out there,
---
## &nbsp;
you making it look so attractive and all.
---
## MYRNA:
I was doing just fine until
the streetcar broke down
---
## &nbsp;
and I had to walk! My
thighs been rubbing together
---
## &nbsp;
like two logs of firewood
since 35th Street.
---
## &nbsp;
Two more blocks and I
coulda started a campfire.
---
## DELLA:
You are by a window.
---
## MYRNA:
And?
---
## DELLA:
And you trying to show all your business
---
## &nbsp;
to the whole street?
---
## MYRNA:
Between you and me,
it's time for my business
---
## &nbsp;
to get back in business,
if you know what I mean.
---
## DELLA:
You just said you wasn't
studying no more men.
---
## MYRNA:
I changed my mind.
---
## &nbsp;
And don't you act so innocent.
---
## &nbsp;
That high and mighty church girl act
---
## &nbsp;
might work with Jimmy
Riley, but I know better.
---
## DELLA:
I'm sure I don't know what you mean.
---
## MYRNA:
"I'm sure I don't know what you mean."
---
## &nbsp;
Yeah, it must be hard to sit down
---
## &nbsp;
with that stick hanging out your ass.
---
## &nbsp;
You been married to the
same man for 18 years,
---
## &nbsp;
ain't seen hide or hair
of him in two weeks,
---
## &nbsp;
and you 'spect me to believe
you ain't looked at Jimmy
---
## &nbsp;
and had trouble keeping
your knees together?
---
## DELLA:
That ain't on everybody's mind.
---
## MYRNA:
Well, Jimmy oughta put it on your mind.
---
## DELLA:
He's a child. He probably
like twenty-something.
---
## MYRNA:
You say that like it's a bad thing.
---
## DELLA:
Jimmy don't want nothing to do with me.
---
## &nbsp;
He does some shopping for me
sometimes. I got a husband.
---
## MYRNA:
Right. I forgot.
---
## DELLA:
And besides, didn't
Jimmy come to Chicago
---
## &nbsp;
to escape his crazy ex-wife?
---
## MYRNA:
Millie Jackson started that rumor
---
## &nbsp;
after he wouldn't go out with her.
---
## &nbsp;
I mean, it ain't her fault
she got that extra tooth,
---
## &nbsp;
but she ain't have to retaliate like that.
---
## DELLA:
So he got somebody?
---
## MYRNA:
Why you ask?
---
## DELLA:
Can't I ask a question?
---
## MYRNA:
I thought you wasn't studying Jimmy.
---
## DELLA:
I ain't. But can't I ask?
---
## MYRNA:
Yeah. I reckon you can ask.
---
## &nbsp;
I talked to Beverly from the
beauty shop and she don't know.
---
## &nbsp;
And you know if Beverly don't
know, it can't be known.

## DELLA:
Yeah. I got nothing better to do.
---
## MYRNA:

---
## DELLA:
Can't I just bake a cake?
---
## MYRNA:
Usually people got some kind of occasion
---
## &nbsp;
for baking a cake. But I s'pose
you just like to bake, huh?
---
## DELLA:
Ain't no occasion. I

---
## MYRNA:

---
## DELLA:

---
## MYRNA:
Here we go. You and these dreams.
---
## DELLA:
I dreamt of a bird
coming back to its nest.
---
## &nbsp;
Don't you think that mean something?
---
## MYRNA:
It sure does.
---
## DELLA:
Myrna, don't you go in that book.
---
## MYRNA:
Oh, hush up. What kinda bird was it?
---
## DELLA:
I don't know. A little one.
---
## MYRNA:
You can't do no better than that?
---
## DELLA:
Uh, it was a sparrow.
---
## MYRNA:
Sparrow... sparrow... oh,
sparrow! Three-eight-six.
---
## &nbsp;
Those your numbers for today.
---
## DELLA:
I ain't playing no policy.
---
## MYRNA:
Why not?
---
## DELLA:
That ain't the way God
choose to bless people.
---
## MYRNA:
You don't know that.
---
## &nbsp;
Girl, you need to take
that dollar I just gave you
---
## &nbsp;
and play it on three-eight-six.
---
## DELLA:
You play that number.
---
## MYRNA:
I can't play your dream
number. It's your dream.
---
## DELLA:
Well, you go on and play your numbers.
---
## &nbsp;
I gotta get this house together.

---
## DELLA:

---
## MYRNA:

---
## DELLA:

---
## &nbsp;
If he too far from home by
the time he done selling,
---
## &nbsp;
he just find a friend to stay with.
---
## &nbsp;
He can't carry all them
shoes home so late at night.
---
## MYRNA:
Well, he ain't never
been gone for two weeks.
---
## DELLA:
He's coming back today.
---
## MYRNA:
Didn't you think that yesterday?
---
## DELLA:
There's things a person knows, Myrna.
---
## &nbsp;
Besides, look at these azaleas.
---
## MYRNA:
What about 'em?
---
## DELLA:
These wasn't here yesterday.
---
## &nbsp;
He must have been here last night. Right?
---
## &nbsp;
So there ain't nothing to worry about.
---
## &nbsp;
Just let me bake my cake.
---
## MYRNA:
Well. If you need some help eating it,
---
## &nbsp;
you know you can call me.
---
## DELLA:

get the oven started.

## YOUNG WAYLAND:
Well, he owe me anyway from
that last time we threw dice.
---
## &nbsp;
I let him slide other times

## &nbsp;
Leather, lasts, soles, all my dyes.

## YOUNG DELLA:
How long you been working on this?

## YOUNG WAYLAND:

## &nbsp;
Gotta be open for business so those folks

---
## &nbsp;
And so's I can make me some
good scratch for my wife
---
## &nbsp;
and my young'un. You hear that?
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
Don't wake him up. I think

---
## &nbsp;
I swear, long as this child lives,
---
## &nbsp;
I will not let him forget

## &nbsp;
when he was in my belly. This for you.

"What's popping? It's your
favorite cousin Snookie."

## YOUNG DELLA:
I didn't know Snookie could write.
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
He can't. Prob'ly got some
girl to write this for him,
---
## &nbsp;
from the looks of it.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
"You still slinging leather down south?
---
## &nbsp;
Things is good up here,
weather starting to turn
---
## &nbsp;
but I'll take twelve months
of winter long as I got
---
## &nbsp;
these pretty gals to keep me warm."

## &nbsp;
Yeah, that's what the world need,

## &nbsp;
more of Snookie's bastard young'uns.

"When you coming up to visit me cousin?

You scared you'll get
up here and not go back?

Nobody would blame you.
---
## &nbsp;
I got me a good job carrying
white folks' bags at a hotel.

## &nbsp;
Three dollars a day ain't a bad haul.
---
## &nbsp;
I blow two and a half of them dollars
---
## &nbsp;
on liquor and pomade, though.
---
## &nbsp;
But the tips,
---
## &nbsp;
I ain't never seen so many white people
---
## &nbsp;
just give away they money.
---
## &nbsp;
And I ain't got no
problems taking it neither.
---
## &nbsp;
They got this one store
called Marshall Field's
---
## &nbsp;
that's got a whole floor
with nothing but shoes.
---
## &nbsp;
You should come up here
---
## &nbsp;
and really show these white
people what a shoe is like.
---
## &nbsp;
Well cousin, this letter dragging on
---
## &nbsp;
and my secretary say
her hand getting tired."

## YOUNG WAYLAND:
What I tell you?

## YOUNG DELLA:
"So I'll leave you.
---
## &nbsp;
I wish I could say I'll
be back down there soon,

## &nbsp;
but I'd be a damn lie.
Be good. Say hi to Della.

Your favorite cousin, Snookie."

Snookie sure is a
firecracker. Man oh man.
---
## &nbsp;
I wonder how long it would take me
---
## &nbsp;
to make a floor full of shoes.
And three dollars a day?
---
## &nbsp;
It would take us a month to make that.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
Until you open Early's Shoe Palace.
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
What was that part
again, about the tips?
---
## &nbsp;
Read that part again.

## YOUNG DELLA:
I'm tired.

## &nbsp;
Old Mr. Rayburn got a
son just went up there.
---
## &nbsp;
He working in a paper mill
for fifty cent an hour.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
Well, that's selfish of him.
---
## &nbsp;
Fifty cent an hour don't replace a daddy.
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
No, but it prob'ly
could buy you a new one.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
That ain't funny.
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
This the future. It'll be our turn soon.
---
## &nbsp;
Once Early's Shoe Palace takes over,

nowhere to go but north.

Don't get attached to

All I need is you.

Then we agree.

## YOUNG WAYLAND:
What happened to your hands?

## YOUNG DELLA:
Leave it alone.

## YOUNG WAYLAND:
You ain't get these
calluses from doing no wash.

## YOUNG DELLA:
I been helping Daddy down
at the old Holcum place.

Just 'til the harvest is over.

My mama had four kids
and picked in the fields

## &nbsp;
up until the day each one of us was born.

## YOUNG WAYLAND:
But you get paid good doing wash.

## YOUNG DELLA:
But we need all we can get.
And we need our own place.

## &nbsp;
And besides, Daddy say we
might could get twelve dollars

## &nbsp;
from of the settle.
---
You should come down
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
to the Dockery place

## &nbsp;
and pick with me, where I can watch you.

## YOUNG DELLA:
I been picking my whole life.

## YOUNG WAYLAND:
But them fields ain't no
place for a woman with child.

## YOUNG DELLA:
It ain't no place for nobody.
---
## &nbsp;
But it's what we got, ain't it?
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
That's the problem with people, Della.
---
## &nbsp;
Coloreds especially. All they
can see is what they got.
---
## &nbsp;
Never mind what they could have
---
## &nbsp;
if they only thought about it.

## YOUNG DELLA:
Later for all that uppity talk.

## YOUNG WAYLAND:
Why is it uppity to
imagine things better

Never mind. I ain't mean
to get you all worked up.

But people are startin' to talk.

Let 'em talk, Della. I don't care.

I didn't think you cared either.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
I don't. But people
don't like it when you act

## &nbsp;
like you too good to be here.

## YOUNG WAYLAND:
"People" don't like
it? Or you don't like it?

## YOUNG DELLA:
Don't put no words in my mouth.

## YOUNG WAYLAND:
I am too good to be here,
Della. And so are you.

Going back down there

For good this time.

## DELLA:
Don't you think we
deserve to be down there?

Have our own land? Who knows
that land better than us?

We worked it and bled
on it and died on it.

Right. Like they gonna be hunky-dorey

You open your eyes,

## &nbsp;
from the night before. They haven't.
---
## &nbsp;
So you shuffle to the bathroom.

## &nbsp;
Brush your teeth, unwrap your hair.

## &nbsp;
Then breakfast. An egg, toast,
maybe a little orange juice.
---
## DELLA:
Orange juice? You do think
my last name is Rockefeller.
---
## JIMMY:
Then you get to work on
whatever somebody need.
---

A cake, a pie, a batch of cookies.

No, everybody got worries.

For one thing, I ain't

Every day that pass is one less chance

to do the things you always wanted to do.

Like what?

## JIMMY:
Oh, all the normal
stuff. Getting married.

Having a nice big busload of kids.

You still got time for that.

## JIMMY:
Problem is I ain't got the patience.

Crazy ex-wife? Where you hear that?

Oh, nowhere. So do you?

Or maybe a banana cake
with coconut frosting!

What?

Sorry. I guess I let my

you know where I'd plant it?

## &nbsp;
Right out there.

So's every time you get
up to look out this window

you'd have you a little
piece of home to look at.

Something to make you
feel like yourself again?

## &nbsp;
You not such a complicated
woman, Della Rose Early.

## &nbsp;
You not so complicated at all.

I just, if I see a chance to fix things...

## &nbsp;
I can't resist it.

## &nbsp;
That's all I seem to spend my time doing.
---
## &nbsp;
Fixing cars, fixing iceboxes,
fixing sinks, fixing radios.

## &nbsp;
Soon as something breaks,

## &nbsp;
I'm hunched over it with a pair of pliers.

## &nbsp;
I'm probably not even good at
it. But I can't help myself.
---

Well, don't nothing
need fixing around here.

Everything's mighty fine.

You could buy a catalog
shoe that don't fit ya,

What can a machine do for
you? A machine don't know you.

I dare any machine, any

and we was talking about
it, and he's going,
---
## &nbsp;
and I'm going, so he asked me
if I wanted to go with him.
---
## DELLA:
You mean like a date?
---
## MYRNA:
No, girl, nothing like that.
Why? You think it's a date?
---
## DELLA:
Man and a woman go
somewhere just the two of 'em,
---
## &nbsp;
I don't know what else to call it.
---
## MYRNA:
I guess you right.
---
## DELLA:
So, what you tell him?
---
## MYRNA:
I told him I didn't know.
---
## DELLA:
Why? Man like Jimmy ask you out,
---
## &nbsp;
what you gonna look like turning him down?
---
## MYRNA:
Seem like he like you.
---
## &nbsp;
He in here every morning
reading you the paper
---
## &nbsp;
and carrying on.
---
## DELLA:
I got a husband, Myrna,
and he ain't Jimmy Riley.
---
## &nbsp;
You two grown folks is free
to do whatever you want.
---
## MYRNA:
All right then. Maybe I'll tell him yes.
---
## DELLA:
You gonna have a good time.
---
## MYRNA:
I'm going crazy thinking
about what to wear.
---
## &nbsp;
Been a good two weeks since
I been touched by a good man.
---
## &nbsp;
Lord, I been missing it.
---
## &nbsp;
Ain't nothing like the smell
of a man's cologne on his body.
---
## &nbsp;
His smell and the cologne
mixing in the air...
---
## &nbsp;
I could pass out thinking about it.
---
## DELLA:
Seem like all you ever
do is think about it.
---
## MYRNA:
You makin' me sound
like some kinda harlot.
---
## DELLA:
No, you just like to have your fun.
---
## MYRNA:
What that mean?
---
## DELLA:
Nothin'. I just never heard of a woman
---
## &nbsp;
thinking so much about
a man's cologne is all.
---
## MYRNA:
We can't all be damsels in distress,
---
## &nbsp;
locked up in our towers
baking chocolate cakes.
---
## &nbsp;
So, can I borrow a pair of
your earrings to wear tonight?
---
## DELLA:
I knew you was after something.
---
## MYRNA:
Them blue ones, that you
wore at Jessie Ray's wedding.
---
## DELLA:
Let me see if I can find 'em.
---
## &nbsp;⌦l
Nope, don't see 'em.
---
## MYRNA:
You only got about
three pair of earrings.
---
## DELLA:
I musta put 'em somewhere else.
---
## MYRNA:
Here they are. You blind?
---
## DELLA:
Well, now that I look at 'em,
---
## &nbsp;
I think the stones are a little loose.
---
## MYRNA:
Oh, they'll be just fine.
---
## &nbsp;
You mind if I come by later
---
## &nbsp;
and show you what I picked out to wear?
---
## DELLA:
You nervous, huh?
---
## MYRNA:
I just think everybody
should get a second opinion
---
## &nbsp;
before they go out in the street.
---
## &nbsp;
You can always tell when somebody
---
## &nbsp;
done walked out they house
without asking nobody.
---
## DELLA:
Just remember,
---
## &nbsp;
Jimmy don't like them low-cut
things you usually wear.
---
## MYRNA:
How you know what Jimmy like?
---
## DELLA:
I'm just guessing. He
is a deacon in the church.
---
## MYRNA:
Please. Church people
just as bad as anybody else
---
## &nbsp;
God ever let draw breath.
---
## &nbsp;
Actually, they worse,
---
## &nbsp;
'cause they don't got the
excuse of being heathens.

Oh!

## &nbsp;
I'm glad you don't have these on yet.
---
## &nbsp;
I had a dream last night. About you.
---
## &nbsp;
You was about five years
old, and on a bicycle,
---
## &nbsp;
only the bicycle was a real big one,
---
## &nbsp;
like the ones from the circus.
---
## &nbsp;
And your daddy was behind
you, pushing the bike along.
---
## &nbsp;
But you keep saying,
"Let me go. Let me go."
---
## &nbsp;
Always too stubborn to take help.
---
## &nbsp;
We know who you got that from.
---
## &nbsp;
And all of a sudden you
just shot off down the road,
---
## &nbsp;
toward the sun. The sun
was so bright in my eyes
---
## &nbsp;
I couldn't tell where you'd gone to.
---
## &nbsp;
And then the sun moved, and
you wasn't there anymore.
---
## &nbsp;
I couldn't find you.
---

## YOUNG DELLA:

## JIMMY:

---
## DELLA:
That's alright.
---
## JIMMY:
You got a wrench?
---
## DELLA:
No.
---
## JIMMY:
How did this happen?
---
## DELLA:
It's been rattling for a while and then,
---
## &nbsp;
I went to turn it on and
it just snapped loose.
---
## &nbsp;
Maybe I oughta call somebody.
---
## JIMMY:
This time of night?
---
## DELLA:
I'll just wait 'til tomorrow.
---
## JIMMY:
I think I got a wrench downstairs.
---
## DELLA:
Oh, it can wait 'til after you get back.
---
## JIMMY:
It's only gonna take a minute.
---
## DELLA:
It's already been half an hour.
---
## JIMMY:
It's easy. I just need a wrench.
---
## DELLA:
Here you were, on your
way out, and I stopped you,
---
## &nbsp;
and now you gonna ruin your nice shirt.
---
## JIMMY:
The shirt ain't as nice as you think.
---
## DELLA:
Really, Jimmy, go. I...I
shouldn'ta opened my mouth.
---
## JIMMY:
It ain't no trouble. Ain't
no trouble at all. I promise.
---
## JIMMY:
Don't be in the dumps.
We gonna get it fixed.
---
## JIMMY:
Oh, I didn't mean, I didn't mean...
---
## MYRNA:
Della, you seen Jimmy?
---
## &nbsp;
I been looking all over for him.
---
## &nbsp;
What's going on here?
---
## JIMMY:
Della's sink was broke. I'm
just gonna fix it right quick.
---
## MYRNA:
Oh. I'll be downstairs.
---
## JIMMY:
Uh, you better just
go on ahead without me.
---
## MYRNA:
You sure?
---
## JIMMY:
I'll catch up.
---
## MYRNA:
Actually, there's something
I need to ask Della.
---
## JIMMY:
Alright.
---
## MYRNA:
Something private.
---
## JIMMY:
Oh. Yeah, I'll go, uh, find that wrench.
---
## MYRNA:
So. Problem with the sink, huh?
---
## &nbsp;
This building is falling apart, ain't it?
---
## DELLA:
Guess so.
---
## MYRNA:
You know, when everybody
out there talks about you,
---
## &nbsp;
I defend you. But you
can't have it both ways.
---
## &nbsp;
You can't pine for one man
---
## &nbsp;
while you busy leading another one on.
---
## DELLA:
You don't know what
you're talking about.
---
## MYRNA:
The hell I don't.
---
## &nbsp;
Wasn't nothing wrong with
your sink three hours ago.
---
## DELLA:
What's the big deal? He
said he would catch up.
---
## MYRNA:
I asked you if you had a problem
---
## &nbsp;
with me going with Jimmy tonight.
---
## DELLA:
I don't. But Jimmy grown.
Free to do what he want.
---
## &nbsp;
And if he wanna fix my sink
I ain't gonna stop him.
---
## MYRNA:
Oh, now he grown?
---
## &nbsp;
A minute ago, he was a
twenty-something child.
---
## DELLA:
You just sore 'cause you think
---
## &nbsp;
I'm keeping him away from you.
---
## MYRNA:
This got nothing to do with me.
---
## DELLA:
Oh, course it does.
---
## &nbsp;
You 'spect to just look at a man twice
---
## &nbsp;
and have him sniffing after you.
---
## &nbsp;
Jimmy a good man. A good God-fearing man.
---
## MYRNA:
So what?
---
## &nbsp;
He don't have no cause to
be seen nowhere with me?
---
## DELLA:
I didn't say that.
---
## MYRNA:
But that's what you think?
---
## DELLA:
You better go. like Jimmy said.
---
## MYRNA:
No, I think if there's
anything else you wanna say,
---
## &nbsp;
you better say it now.
---
## DELLA:
I ain't judging you, Myrna.
---
## &nbsp;
All I'm saying is that it ain't wise
---
## &nbsp;
for you and Jimmy to start anything.
---
## MYRNA:
I was being nice even
talking to you about it
---
## &nbsp;
in the first place. It really
ain't none of your business.
---
## DELLA:
I'm just looking out for you.
---
## MYRNA:
By protecting me from a deacon?
---
## &nbsp;
You looking out for your damn self.
---
## &nbsp;
You scared I might get in the way
---
## &nbsp;
of your precious coffee
time with your errand boy.
---
## DELLA:
Errand boy?
---
## MYRNA:
You got him to the grocery store,
---
## &nbsp;
making him fetch the newspaper.
---
## &nbsp;
All so you can have somebody
to warm Wayland's chair.
---
## DELLA:
This is probably gonna shock you,
---
## &nbsp;
but a woman can be friends with a man
---
## &nbsp;
without opening her legs.
---
## MYRNA:
Watch yourself, Della.
---
## DELLA:
There's two kinds of woman.
---
## &nbsp;
The kind a man marries,
and the other kind.
---
## &nbsp;
The kind he keeps on the side.
---
## &nbsp;
To use like an old washrag
and then throw away.
---
## &nbsp;
Which kind are you?
---
## MYRNA:
You right. I wish to God
I had a husband like yours,
---
## &nbsp;
so I could have somebody
to take me for granted
---
## &nbsp;
and leave home for days
at a time without calling.
---
## &nbsp;
Lucky you.
---
## DELLA:
We made vows to each
other. Eighteen years ago.
---
## &nbsp;
But I don't expect you to understand that.
---
## MYRNA:
And what you got to show
for it? A bunch of shoes?
---
## &nbsp;
So judge me if you want to
---
## &nbsp;
but hold that mirror up to yourself, too.
---
## DELLA:
We getting out of here. We
going back to where we started.
---
## &nbsp;
I done saved up enough money
---
## &nbsp;
for both of us to get out of here.
---
## &nbsp;
I'm the only somebody he's got.
---
## MYRNA:
But you ain't got him! Where he at?
---
## &nbsp;
He could be dead in some ditch
somewhere for all you know.
---
## DELLA:
Oh, no! He was here.
He was here last night.
---
## &nbsp;
He left me these azaleas!
---
## MYRNA:
Della. You know these
been here for three days.
---
## DELLA:
What? No they ain't.
---
## MYRNA:
Yes ,they have. I'm the
one who brought 'em over.
---
## DELLA:
No. Wayland brought these last night.
---
## MYRNA:
You like white ones.
---
## &nbsp;
But all I could get was the pink ones.
---
## &nbsp;
I thought they would cheer you
up. You don't remember that?
---
## DELLA:
But, I saw him leave them here.
---
## MYRNA:
No. You didn't.
---
## DELLA:
But, I got everything
ready for him to come back.
---
## MYRNA:
Even so, what you gon' do?
---
## &nbsp;
Just sit by the window?
---
## &nbsp;
Bakin' a cake? In a house dress?
---
## &nbsp;
People make fun of you
out there. They pity you.
---
## &nbsp;
They walk past your window
and just shake their heads.
---
## &nbsp;
Call you a sad old lady.
---
## &nbsp;
And I don't know what
to do for you 'cause now
---
## &nbsp;
I see what they see.
---
## &nbsp;
A sad old lady. And I pity you too.
---
## DELLA:
Well. Pity me from someplace else.
---
## &nbsp;
My earrings.

Whether you know it or not.
And I never could do that.

Everybody else always had
the better part of me.

But now I want it back.

borrow it from ya. For the sink.

---
## DELLA:
Don't you think we got
something to celebrate?
---
## WAYLAND:
Something like what?
---
## DELLA:
I dreamed of a rainstorm last night.
---
## &nbsp;
We was both caught in it, me and you.
---
## &nbsp;
And you couldn't see your
hand in front of your face
---
## &nbsp;
for all the wind and rain.
---
## &nbsp;
And I could hear you
but I couldn't find you.
---
## &nbsp;
And at first I was scared.
---
## &nbsp;
But then I felt this peace.
---
## &nbsp;
Because I knew that the
rain was washing us clean.
---
## &nbsp;
Me and you.
---
## &nbsp;
We was being washed clean so
we could start something over.
---
## &nbsp;
Now before you say anything-
---
## WAYLAND:
Where you get this?
---
## DELLA:
Before you say anything, just listen.
---
## WAYLAND:
How much is this?
---
## DELLA:
Twenty-seven dollars
and thirty-five cents.
---
## WAYLAND:
Where you get it?
---
## DELLA:
I made it. On cakes and pies.
---
## WAYLAND:
You saved this up?
---
## DELLA:
Little by little.
---
## WAYLAND:
How long?
---
## DELLA:
Seven months, maybe eight.
---
## WAYLAND:
You just now telling me about it?
---
## DELLA:
I was waiting for the right time.
---
## WAYLAND:
Well, if this ain't
just in time for rent.
---
## DELLA:
Mrs. Elkins been waiting a
month and a half for our rent.
---
## &nbsp;
She can wait a little while longer.
---
## WAYLAND:
Why else you saving it up then?
---
## DELLA:
Elbert finally answered
the letter I wrote him.
---
## WAYLAND:
He got some nerve begging us for money.
---
## DELLA:
No, he don't want no money.
---
## WAYLAND:
What he want then?
---
## DELLA:
I figured out that a train ticket
---
## &nbsp;
only cost eleven dollars and fifty cent.
---
## &nbsp;
That mean we got enough here
for two tickets. And then some.
---
## WAYLAND:
For what, a visit?
---
## DELLA:
Not exactly.
---
## &nbsp;
He said our uncle done left him four acres
---
## &nbsp;
right by Highway 49.
---
## &nbsp;
He said we could live on it.
---
## WAYLAND:
Live on it?
---
## DELLA:
I know four acres ain't much,
---
## &nbsp;
but it's enough to have
a house. And a shop.
---
## &nbsp;
And it's right by highway 49.
---
## &nbsp;
You know how many people
must pass by there every day?
---
## WAYLAND:
What are you saying?
---
## DELLA:
Things been hard for us. Real hard.
---
## &nbsp;
And things ain't changed,
---
## &nbsp;
so maybe we gotta change, you know?
---
## WAYLAND:
Della.
---
## DELLA:
I know. I know.
---
## &nbsp;
All I'm saying is let's
just go look at it.
---
## WAYLAND:
It's real sweet that
you done saved this up.
---
## &nbsp;
And this is a nice surprise and all,
---
## &nbsp;
but ain't nothing going
on in that country town.
---
## DELLA:
"That country town?"
That's where we from.
---
## WAYLAND:
And we was lucky to get out
the first time. You know that.
---
## DELLA:
Don't you wanna have
your own stuff again?
---
## &nbsp;
Ain't you tired of scraping
just to turn around
---
## &nbsp;
and give what you make to Mrs. Elkins?
---
## WAYLAND:
Say we use this to get on
the train and go down there.
---
## &nbsp;
Then what?
---
## DELLA:
We ain't exactly have a
plan coming up here, did we?
---
## &nbsp;
I knew you would be back.
---
## &nbsp;
I saved up this money for today.
---
## &nbsp;
I was wondering when I
should tell you about it
---
## &nbsp;
but my dream told me that
this is the right time.
---
## &nbsp;
We ready to make a change.
---
## &nbsp;
Time come when your head hit the ceiling
---
## &nbsp;
and you gotta bust through.
---
## &nbsp;
You once asked me if I
trusted you. And I said yes.
---
## &nbsp;
You remember that?
---
## WAYLAND:
Yeah.
---
## DELLA:
But now it's your turn to trust me.
---
## &nbsp;
We gonna get back on our feet.
---
## &nbsp;
So do you trust me?

Well, I know that's only
seventy-five cents difference,
---
## &nbsp;
but I don't need to tell you
---
## &nbsp;
what a difference
seventy-five cents can make.
---
## &nbsp;
I can buy potatoes to last six months
---
## &nbsp;
with seventy-five cents.
---
## &nbsp;
Well, I ain't tryin' to
make you feel bad, I just-
---
## &nbsp;
well, no matter how hard things get,
---
## &nbsp;
we gotta be men about
it, you know what I mean.
---
## &nbsp;
We gotta be men.
---
## &nbsp;
That mean we gotta keep our
word when we agree on a price,
---
## &nbsp;
you understand?
---
## &nbsp;
I'll be able to charge you
less once I open a place
---
## &nbsp;
and can make more inventory.
---
## &nbsp;
Hell, I might hire you one
day to do some sellin'.
---
## &nbsp;
So what you say, Hank, huh?
---
## &nbsp;
Can you give me two-fifty?
---
## &nbsp;
All right, all right, I'll
take one seventy-five,
---
## &nbsp;
I'll take that.
---
## &nbsp;
You just gotta promise
me you'll stay loyal.
---
## &nbsp;
Don't let me catch you in
no Florsheims, you hear?
---
## &nbsp;
This pair of Earlies'll take you farther
---
## &nbsp;
than them shoes ever will.
---
## &nbsp;
Alright, you too.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
Them shoes ain't never took me nowhere.
---
## &nbsp;
Nowhere good, anyway.
---
## WAYLAND:
Lie. They brought you here.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
And what good did that do me?
---
## WAYLAND:
I told you. My dreams was
big enough for both of us.
---
## &nbsp;
They still are.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
He was breathing.
---
## &nbsp;
His little tiny chest
was moving up and down.
---
## &nbsp;
I could feel his heart beating.
---
## WAYLAND:
I don't want that. I
don't want no memories.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
So what should I do?
Hide 'em in secret corners
---
## &nbsp;
where you won't never look?
---
## WAYLAND:
You ain't never been able
to keep a secret from me.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
I kept that money secret, didn't I?
---
## WAYLAND:
Well, it ain't a secret now, is it?
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
It's only a matter of
time before you manage
---
## &nbsp;
to mess this up.
---
## WAYLAND:
You bout to see right now.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
He's under an oak tree
in Tennessee somewhere
---
## &nbsp;
and you don't even care.
---
## WAYLAND:
Who you think I'm doing this
for? I'm doing it for him.
---
## &nbsp;
And for you. And for Mama. For all of you.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
He ain't here. And Mama ain't here.
---
## &nbsp;
It's just me, Wayland. It's just me.
---
## WAYLAND:
What's just you?
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
Huh?
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
You said it's just you. What's just you?
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
Nothing.
---
## &nbsp;
Uh. I found a man with some biscuits.
---
## &nbsp;
I told him I was having
triplets, so he gave me three.
---
## &nbsp;
Let me see.
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
I'm alright.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
Wayland. Let me see.
---
## &nbsp;
My Lord!
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
It's a scratch.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
Where else are you hurt?
---
template: noise
painful cry
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
Is it broke?
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
Don't worry.
---
## &nbsp;
I just need some corn liquor
and some decent sleep.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
You lucky that eye is
still in your head. Here.
---
## &nbsp;
Be still.
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
It's not as bad as it look.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
Well, you don't know how it look.
---
## &nbsp;
Now, where we gettin' off?
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
I don't know.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
We can't be on this train forever.
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
I know that, just, just let me think.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
How did this happen?
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
I told you.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
No. You didn't.
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
It was a man. Two men. Maybe three.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
Well, was it two or three?
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
I don't remember.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
And they just walked up and hit you?
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
I don't know. It happened too fast.
---
## &nbsp;
Why you asking all these
questions? I'm the one bleeding.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
I ain't trying to pick at you.
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
Just trying to work my nerves?
---
## &nbsp;
I'm sorry.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
I'm just tryin' to figure
out what we should do.
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
I'm thinkin' about that.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
So, do we hide somewhere
for a couple days?
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
It ain't that simple.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
Well, why ain't it?
---
## &nbsp;
Did you do something to somebody?
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
You saying I started it?
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
No. I, I just know how you are.
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
How am I?
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
Never mind.
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
No, how am I?
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
You right. It ain't as bad as it look.
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
You don't know what it like, Della.
---
## &nbsp;
Having people calling you
boy your whole natural life.
---
## &nbsp;
Grown man got to step off the sidewalk
---
## &nbsp;
for a ten-year-old boy
---
## &nbsp;
just 'cause that boy happen to be white.
---
## &nbsp;
Only so many times you
can stand that before you-
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
Before you what?
---
## &nbsp;
Before you what? Wayland. Answer me.
---
## &nbsp;
Did you do something to somebody?
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
Only doin' what's been done to me.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
What did you do?
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
They spit on my shoes,
Della. They spit on 'em.
---
## &nbsp;
I asked 'em if they wanted to try one on.
---
## &nbsp;
I even called 'em sir.
---
## &nbsp;
Told 'em one of my shoes was better
---
## &nbsp;
than a thousand they could
order from Mr. Montgomery Ward.
---
## &nbsp;
And then one of 'em spit
on my shoes and said,
---
## &nbsp;
"Not anymore, boy." So I hit him.
---
## &nbsp;
I hit him hard as I could, Della.
---
## &nbsp;
They mighta got me on the run,
---
## &nbsp;
but I showed 'em I wasn't no boy.
---
template: noise

---
## YOUNG DELLA:
You got me out here begging
for biscuits like a dog
---
## &nbsp;
because somebody spit on your shoes?
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
Today they spitting on my shoes, Della.
---
## &nbsp;
Should I just wait around
---
## &nbsp;
to see what they gonna do tomorrow?
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
People always gonna do things to you.
---
## &nbsp;
You think I like working my hands raw
---
## &nbsp;
just to get a dollar or
two at the end of harvest?
---
## &nbsp;
All with a child in my belly?
---
## &nbsp;
You take what God give
you and you count it joy.
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
You might be able to find
the joy in that kinda life,
---
## &nbsp;
Della, I can't.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
Then what else you gonna do?
---
## &nbsp;
Punch everybody who disrespect you?
---
## &nbsp;
You ain't got enough fists!
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
I'm not just gonna lie down
and take that kinda treatment,
---
## &nbsp;
Della, and neither should
you. Where's your pride?
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
Oh, well I'm glad you
have time for pride.
---
## &nbsp;
I have to think about how
to feed myself and my child.
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
My pride is what you like
about me. You said so yourself.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
It's what I love about you.
---
## &nbsp;
But your pride got us
hiding in a baggage car,
---
## &nbsp;
without a dollar between us.
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
You gotta trust that
I'm gonna figure that out.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
Well, figure it out quick, Wayland,
---
## &nbsp;
'cause this train is moving real fast.
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
What if we don't go back?
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
What?
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
In Clarksdale we can
catch the Illy Central,
---
## &nbsp;
take us all the way to Chicago.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
No, no, no.
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
Ain't nothing left for
us in Sunflower County.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
We can't go to Chicago. We got nothing.
---
## &nbsp;
We already begging, and we
ain't even out of Mississippi.
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
We just have to make it to Chicago.
---
## &nbsp;
Snookie already there.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
No. We ain't running like
we some kinda fugitives.
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
I pretty much am a
fugitive by now, Della.
---
## &nbsp;
'Sides, we could start over.
We can start our family.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
What about my family?
My daddy? My brothers?
---
## &nbsp;
I'm s'posed to just up and leave 'em
---
## &nbsp;
without so much as a goodbye?

We ain't got no choice. But

Yeah, I just had a wash
and wrap. But you noticed.

Course I noticed.
---
## DELLA:
You in a good mood.
---
## WAYLAND:
Why not? You were right.
---
## DELLA:
About what?
---
## WAYLAND:
About things changing.
---
## &nbsp;
One thing I know for sure
---
## &nbsp;
is that things gonna change in a big way.
---
## DELLA:
Really? You mean that?
---
## WAYLAND:
I promise.
---
## &nbsp;
Good evening, Myrna.

## DELLA:
Myrna?
---
## MYRNA:
I was just coming to check on you, Della,

## &nbsp;
but I s'pose you don't need me to now.
---
## WAYLAND:
Aw, come on in, Myrna.
---
## MYRNA:
You sure?
---
## WAYLAND:
Yeah, stay a while. We did
get a Cornish hen, after all.
---
## MYRNA:
Welcome home.
---
## DELLA:
You work today?
---
## MYRNA:
Breakfast and lunch.
---
## DELLA:
You worked breakfast too?
---
## &nbsp;
You ain't get home late last night?
---
## MYRNA:
No, not too late.
---
## DELLA:
Myrna went to see Albert Ammons, too.
---
## WAYLAND:
You and Jimmy go together?
---
## MYRNA:
Uh, I don't know. Not exactly.
---
## WAYLAND:
You don't know?
---
## WAYLAND:
Let me guess. You asked him
to go with you and he said no.
---
## MYRNA:
When you ever know
somebody to turn me down?
---
## WAYLAND:
So what happened?
---
## DELLA:
This don't sound like
---
## &nbsp;
appropriate dinner table conversation.
---
## WAYLAND:
Oh, no why Myrna ain't
never cared about that.
---
## &nbsp;
Why you so shy now?
---
## &nbsp;
Not even the deacon
couldn't resist you, huh?
---
## &nbsp;
Man-eatin' Myrna strikes again.
---
## &nbsp;
Old Jimmy didn't stand a chance, did he?
---
## DELLA:
We shouldn't be talkin' about somebody
---
## &nbsp;
behind they back like this.
---
## WAYLAND:
You right. We should see if he home.
---
## &nbsp;
He might notta eat yet.
---
## DELLA:
I don't think I got enough for four.
---
## WAYLAND:
Come on now, sweetheart.
Have some hospitality.
---
## DELLA:
I think he said he was workin' late.
---
## WAYLAND:
Why don't we make sure?
---
## DELLA:
I'm sure. He's workin' late.
---
## WAYLAND:
I'll go see.
---
## DELLA:
No. I'll go. And, uh,
we need some water anyway.
---
## &nbsp;
The sink's still broken.
---
## MYRNA:
Well, well. The old rooster
came home to crow, huh?
---
## WAYLAND:
Excuse me?
---
## MYRNA:
Nice of you to, uh, grace
your wife with your presence.
---
## WAYLAND:
You funny, Myrna.
---
## &nbsp;
Can you believe Della
bought a Cornish hen?
---
## MYRNA:
She woulda bought a
whole farm of chickens
---
## &nbsp;
if she thought it would
bring you home sooner.
---
## WAYLAND:
There's things you
don't understand, Myrna.
---
## MYRNA:
No, Wayland, there's
something you don't understand.
---
## &nbsp;
A woman ain't taught the
same thing a man is taught.
---
## &nbsp;
We ain't taught how to
have our own, keep our own.
---
## &nbsp;
We taught to let the man drive
---
## &nbsp;
and just giggle about how nice the view is
---
## &nbsp;
from the passenger side.
---
## &nbsp;
Della been riding in the
passenger side for eighteen years,
---
## &nbsp;
but she tired. She tired.
---
## &nbsp;
Every time I see her,
there's less of her there.
---
## WAYLAND:
You think you know Della?
Della ain't like you.
---
## &nbsp;
She's smarter than you.
---
## &nbsp;
She know better than to
work some dead end job
---
## &nbsp;
and spend all her money
playing the policy.
---
## &nbsp;
So you been kind to look after her,
---
## &nbsp;
but I'll thank you kindly not
to worry about her no more.
---
## MYRNA:
All I'm saying is, it wasn't your jacket
---
## &nbsp;
draped over that chair last night, was it?
---
## DELLA:
He wasn't home.
---
## &nbsp;
Y'all alright?

I was just... well, I
heard you knock, Della,

## &nbsp;
but when I came to the door
---
## &nbsp;
you was already running back up here.

## &nbsp;
Didn't you hear me call after you?

## DELLA:
Oh. Uh, no. I ain't hear nothing.
---
## WAYLAND:
Please. Join us.
---
## JIMMY:
Oh, I couldn't.
---
## WAYLAND:
Sure you could.
---
## WAYLAND:
Now that we're all here,
I want to propose a toast.
---
## JIMMY:
Whoa.
---
## DELLA:
Where you get that?
---
## MYRNA:
Where you steal that?
---
## WAYLAND:
Ain't nobody stole nothing.
---
## &nbsp;
This is a special occasion.
---
## &nbsp;
With friends. Calls
for a special libation.
---
## &nbsp;
Della, dear. Get the wine glasses.
---
## DELLA:
We ain't got no wine glasses.
---
## WAYLAND:
Guess we just gonna have
to pass the bottle around.
---
## DELLA:
Wayland, please put that away.
---
## WAYLAND:
Oh, come on, now. Jesus turned
water into wine, didn't he?
---
## &nbsp;
Anyway, I would like to
toast to dear friends,
---
## &nbsp;
old, and new, who have stood by us.
---
## &nbsp;
We'll always remember you.
---
## &nbsp;
Y'all sure y'all don't want none?
---
## &nbsp;
Alright then. More for me.
---
## &nbsp;
Let's eat.
---
## DELLA:
Jimmy, would you mind sayin' grace?
---
## JIMMY:
Of course not.
---
## WAYLAND:
Is Deacon Jimmy the only somebody
---
## &nbsp;
who speaks the Lord's
language around here?
---
## &nbsp;
We are in my house, ain't we?
---
## DELLA:
Alright, Wayland. Go ahead.
---
## WAYLAND:
Close your eyes.
---
## WAYLAND:
Dear Lord. We thank you for this food,
---
## &nbsp;
we thank you for
fellowship, and most of all,
---
## &nbsp;
we thank you for second chances. Amen.
---
## DELLA:
Wayland, that was real nice.
---
## &nbsp;
I never heard you pray like that.
---
## WAYLAND:
I still got some brand-new in me.
---
## JIMMY:
I ain't had meat all week!
---
## WAYLAND:
This the only hen we got?
---
## DELLA:
Grady only gave me the one.
I thought it would just be us.
---
## JIMMY:
Oh, I don't need to eat none.
---
## &nbsp;
Just smelling it is good enough for me.
---
## WAYLAND:
That's beside the point.
Grady too damn tight.
---
## &nbsp;
I let them wingtips slide
for two dollars even
---
## &nbsp;
and he can't extend nobody no credit?
---
## &nbsp;
He better ask somebody else
next time he need some shoes.
---
## &nbsp;
Matter fact, we takin'
our business elsewhere.
---
## DELLA:
Where else we 'spect to go?
---
## WAYLAND:
I found me a good place up on Cermak.
---
## DELLA:
Cermak? What was you doin' up on Cermak?
---
## WAYLAND:
Go look in the icebox. In
the back. Wrapped in paper.
---
## DELLA:
What is this?
---
## WAYLAND:
Open it.
---
## &nbsp;
Sirloin, baby!
---
## &nbsp;
Cook it up now, before it go bad.
---
## JIMMY:
How you even cook that?
---
## DELLA:
I'll, uh, I'll put it back.
---
## WAYLAND:
Why you gonna do something like that?
---
## DELLA:
We gotta save this.
---
## MYRNA:
You sure you ain't stole nothing?
---
## WAYLAND:
That's the second time you said that.
---
## &nbsp;
You think I can't come by stuff honest?
---
## MYRNA:
Not this kinda stuff.
---
## MYRNA:
Alright, now Wayland,
---
## &nbsp;
where you get the money for all this?
---
## WAYLAND:
Don't worry about that.
---
## MYRNA:
Oh Lord. He done stole it.
---
## WAYLAND:
Well, if I did, it reflect
poorly on you, don't it?
---
## &nbsp;
Dining with thieves?
---
## DELLA:
Calm down.
---
## WAYLAND:
You think it's proper to
insult a man in his own house?
---
## MYRNA:
I couldn't tell it was your house
---
## &nbsp;
two weeks ago when you left it.
---
## WAYLAND:
You think you got all the answers?
---
## &nbsp;
You think you can wrap your head
---
## &nbsp;
around everything that
happen in this house?
---
## &nbsp;
While you worried about us,
---
## &nbsp;
you need to worry about your man,
---
## &nbsp;
'scuse me, your ex, and why he out there

## &nbsp;
wrappin' Charlene
Robinson up in mink coats.

## DELLA:
Myrna, please. Please.
Let's just everybody relax.
---
## &nbsp;
We got this one good Cornish hen. Please.
---
## WAYLAND:
You right. You right.
---
## &nbsp;
This is a special occasion, after all.
---
## &nbsp;
Oh, now, Myrna Lee, don't
be sore at me. Sit on down.
---
## &nbsp;
Eat some more of this here bird.

You know how hard Della worked.

Don't you be sore at me"

## WAYLAND:
I could make a record out of that.

## &nbsp;
I used to sing. Y'all know that?
---
## JIMMY:
You used to sing?
---
## WAYLAND:
Yeah, me and some other boys
---
## &nbsp;
used to have us a little
gospel band. Yessir.
---
## &nbsp;
When I was 'round fourteen.
Just before the war.
---
## &nbsp;
That's how I got my name.
Della know this story.
---
## DELLA:
Mm-hmm.
---
## &nbsp;
I used to back up this guy
named Lou. Big slab of a man.
---
## &nbsp;
His folks was Louisiana somewheres.
---
## &nbsp;
He used to lead off, and
me and this other boy Eddie
---
## &nbsp;
used to come in and back him up.
---
## &nbsp;
Well, I was so excited just
to be in his little old band
---
## &nbsp;
that I would always come in early.
---
## &nbsp;
I'm trying to sing backup
but ain't nothing to back up!

Wayland laughs

## &nbsp;
Every time I used to come in early.
---
## &nbsp;
They eventually started
calling me Wayland Early.
---
## &nbsp;
Didn't nobody know my last name anyway.
---
## &nbsp;
I didn't even know my last name.
---
## &nbsp;
Early sounded good enough to me.
---
## JIMMY:
That's where your last name came from?
---
## WAYLAND:
If I'm lying, I'm flying.
Ain't that the story, Della?
---
## DELLA:
Mm-hmm.
---
## &nbsp;
Mm-hmm.
---
## JIMMY:
When I was a kid,
---
## &nbsp;
me and my brothers used to
pretend we had us a band.
---
## &nbsp;
I thought I was Cab Calloway.
---
## &nbsp;
You know, that's what this
building needs more of.
---
## &nbsp;
I'm tired of looking at
all these grown folks.

I hope whoever move in next got some kids.

I carve that name into

---
## &nbsp;
so's people know where they came from.
---
## &nbsp;
My name probably written
all over this city.
---
## &nbsp;
Come to think of it, Jimmy,
---
## &nbsp;
you look like you could
use a new pair yourself.
---
## JIMMY:
Oh, I don't think I could
afford a pair of Earlies.
---
## WAYLAND:
Well I tell you what?
---
## &nbsp;
I'll give you a discount
on your first pair.
---
## &nbsp;
'Cause it certainly won't be your last.

## DELLA:
Wayland's customers are very loyal.

## WAYLAND:
Could you picture old Jimmy
---
## &nbsp;
stepping into the DeLisa
with a pair of Earlies on?
---
## &nbsp;
You'd be fighting off them
women with a baseball bat.
---
## JIMMY:
Really now?
---
## WAYLAND:
Oh, yeah. I'm gonna let
you in on a little secret.

First thing a woman notices
about a man is his shoes.
---
## &nbsp;
Says a lot about how well
he can take care of himself.
---
## &nbsp;
And her. You know what I'm
saying? Upward mobility.
---
## &nbsp;
You know, people don't
talk about that no more.
---
## &nbsp;
I'm talking about reaching for something.
---
## &nbsp;
That's the problem with the
colored man in America today.
---
## &nbsp;
He ain't got no ambition.
See, them Johnny white boys,
---
## &nbsp;
they got on they Wall Street
suits, stepping all over each
---
## &nbsp;
other, trying to make another
dollar, sell another share.
---
## &nbsp;
They got gumption.
---
## &nbsp;
They what the high-falutin' educated folks
---
## &nbsp;
call "resourceful." And what we doing?
---
## &nbsp;
Servin' other people they breakfasts.
---
## &nbsp;
Putting mufflers on other people's cars.

## &nbsp;
What you think, Jimmy? What's your dream?
---
## JIMMY:
I'm living my dream.
---
## WAYLAND:
You for real?
---
## JIMMY:
Why not?
---
## &nbsp;
I got Jesus, and a good-paying job.
---
## &nbsp;
And once in a while,
---
## &nbsp;
I sit down with my good
friends for a nice dinner.
---
## DELLA:
That's nice.
---
## WAYLAND:
Yeah. That is nice.
And then you'll be dead.
---
## &nbsp;
And won't nobody remember
you was ever here.
---
## &nbsp;
Your name gonna die with you.

---
## WAYLAND:
Don't you want things out of life?

Man, all I ask out of life

Somebody should be writing that down.

That right there is a good line, ain't it?

## &nbsp;
I bet that works real nice
on the womenfolk, huh?
---
## &nbsp;
They go crazy over that shit, huh?
---
## DELLA:
Wayland!
---
## WAYLAND:
You know, I appreciate all
that humble stuff, Jimmy.
---
## &nbsp;
But ambition is what set people apart.
---
## &nbsp;
Me and Della, we got that. Don't we?
---
## DELLA:
I don't know.
---
## WAYLAND:
When our heads hit the
ceiling, we bust through.
---
## &nbsp;
Della told me that this
morning. And she right.
---
## DELLA:
I am?
---
## WAYLAND:
Yeah. And that's why
I wanted y'all here.
---
## &nbsp;
I got something to tell y'all.
---
## DELLA:
Wait. Let's tell them over dessert.
---
## &nbsp;
You see I baked a cake.
---
## JIMMY:
I bet it's delicious.
---
## &nbsp;;myr
I don't think I'll be
able to stay for dessert.

## WAYLAND:
I got dessert right here.

You know 43rd and Indiana?

Where Jessie Ray's daddy used

## &nbsp;
That's gonna be the site of

Early's New and Improved Shoe Palace!
---
## DELLA:
What you mean?
---
## WAYLAND:
We got a shop!
---
## DELLA:
How?
---
## WAYLAND:
I'm gonna take over the place.
---
## &nbsp;
I gave 'em twenty-three dollars
---
## &nbsp;
to pay the rent on it 'til June.
---
## &nbsp;
And I used the rest to
treat my one and only girl
---
## &nbsp;
to some champagne and a sirloin steak!
---
## DELLA:
The rest?
---
## WAYLAND:
Oh, we back, baby! And
it's all thanks to you.
---
## &nbsp;
You said we needed to do
something to make a change.
---
## &nbsp;
So I did. And now it's
only a matter of time
---
## &nbsp;
before I can hire me
some people for cheap,
---
## &nbsp;
teach them all how to
make a shoe the right way.
---
## &nbsp;
Marshall Field's won't even see me coming!
---
## DELLA:
You just took it? Took it all?
---
## WAYLAND:
What you talkin' about?

## DELLA:
Did it even cross your mind
---
## &nbsp;
that maybe I might have a problem with you
---
## &nbsp;
just up and blowing it on
some goddamn storefront?

---
## JIMMY:
Thank you for dinner.
---
## MYRNA:
Yeah, thank you.

## JIMMY:
Y'all take care.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
I dreamed of you last night.
---
## &nbsp;
You had a crown on your
head, and you was smiling.
---
## &nbsp;
And your smile was so bright
I almost couldn't see.
---
## &nbsp;
And then the light of your smile grew
---
## &nbsp;
bigger and bigger and bigger
until it was surrounding me
---
## &nbsp;
and I was flying up with the light.
---
## &nbsp;
I was flying with you!
---
## &nbsp;
The clouds was like pillows.
---
## &nbsp;
And the light was so warm!
---
## &nbsp;
But then we got too high. And
you turned to me and said,
---
## &nbsp;
"You gotta stop here." And
you just kept on going.
---
## &nbsp;
And I was so proud. 'Cause you flew.
---
## &nbsp;
Just like you flew out of me.
---
## &nbsp;
And just now, you looked at
me with those brown eyes,
---
## &nbsp;
and you remembered me. From the dream.
---
## &nbsp;
'Cause it was your dream, too, wasn't it?
---
## &nbsp;
It was your dream too.
---
## &nbsp;
And you been so good,
---
## &nbsp;
you ain't made one
little itty bitty sound.
---
## &nbsp;
But you can cry now.
---
## &nbsp;
You go on ahead and draw
one great big breath
---
## &nbsp;
and just cry as big and
as loud as you can, okay?
---
## &nbsp;
Mama's listening. You go on ahead.
---
## &nbsp;
Cry. Cry.
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
Della.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
Cry.
---
## &nbsp;
Cry. Cry. Cry!
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
Della. He's...
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
He, he breathed, didn't he?
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
Della.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
He breathed. He could
still be trying to breathe.
---
## &nbsp;
Right now. He could be trying.
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
He ain't trying.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
How you know?
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
We gotta keep going.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
No.
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
I just... I just put him under the tree.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
Oh, no. No.
---
## &nbsp;
We could be wrong. What if we wrong?
---
## &nbsp;
No, no.
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
Della, please.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
No, no, no!
---
## &nbsp;
If he's with the dirt, then
that's what I wanna be.
---
## &nbsp;
I want the Lord to turn me into dirt,
---
## &nbsp;
so I can hold my baby, so I can hold him.
---
## &nbsp;
No! I don't want this skin.
---
## &nbsp;
I wanna be dust and dirt and
earth. Please, God. Please.
---
## &nbsp;
Please, just another couple of hours.
---
## &nbsp;
He'll cry! We'll hear him. He'll cry.
---
## &nbsp;
He'll cry, we'll hear him, please. Please.
---
## &nbsp;
Cry! Cry! CRY!

## &nbsp;
Della, what's wrong with you?
---
## &nbsp;
Della, say something.
---
## DELLA:
You know something?
---
## &nbsp;
I never bothered to ask you where you was.
---
## &nbsp;
It never even occurred
to me to ask you that.
---
## WAYLAND:
Oh.
---
## DELLA:
So?
---
## WAYLAND:
What?
---
## DELLA:
Where was you?
---
## WAYLAND:
I don't remember every second.
---
## &nbsp;
I was trying to decide
what we gonna do next.
---
## &nbsp;
But now I know.
---
## DELLA:
You didn't think of what I
wanted to do with that money.
---
## &nbsp;
You think it's alright to just
---
## &nbsp;
throw away my hard work like that?
---
## &nbsp;
I worked and saved for eight months.
---
## WAYLAND:
You ain't the only one been working.
---
## &nbsp;
You don't understand what I been through
---
## &nbsp;
these last couple of weeks.
---
## DELLA:
What you been through
these "last couple of weeks"?
---
## &nbsp;
That's what I been through
---
## &nbsp;
the last eighteen years in this apartment.
---
## WAYLAND:
I know, I know. You hate it here.
---
## &nbsp;
You not exactly the best at hiding it.
---
## DELLA:
Could you blame me?
You left me here, alone.
---
## &nbsp;
What am I supposed to think?
---
## WAYLAND:
There. That's the look.
---
## &nbsp;
That look I can't stand.
---
## DELLA:
What look?
---
## WAYLAND:
I wish you could see how your
eyes get. They turn so cold.
---
## &nbsp;
I couldn't take those eyes anymore.
---
## &nbsp;
Watching. Judging. Expecting.
---
## &nbsp;
You always expecting so much outta me,
---
## &nbsp;
so much I don't think I can give.
---
## DELLA:
What's wrong with me
expecting something from you?
---
## &nbsp;
Yes. I expect you to support this house.
---
## &nbsp;
I expect for you to do right by me.
---
## &nbsp;
And I expect you to come
home to me every night,
---
## &nbsp;
not just when you feel like it.
---
## WAYLAND:
Put yourself in my
place. Could you face you?
---
## DELLA:
Oh, so you was out in
the streets for two weeks
---
## &nbsp;
'cause you couldn't face me?
---
## WAYLAND:
That's what I'm telling you.
---
## DELLA:
Well, who could you
face? Who was you with?
---
## WAYLAND:
Why does that matter? I'm back, ain't I?
---
## DELLA:
You been with another woman? Hm?
---
## &nbsp;
You tracking dirt into this house?
---
## &nbsp;
Huh? Speak up.
---
## &nbsp;
Oh, that's right. You can't remember.
---
## &nbsp;
Well, that's a shame.
---
## &nbsp;
'Cause I remember every moment
of Jimmy being up inside me.
---
## WAYLAND:
What?
---
## DELLA:
You heard me.
---
## WAYLAND:
You been with Jimmy?
---
## DELLA:
Why does it matter? You back, ain't you?
---
## WAYLAND:
You wouldn't dare be with Jimmy.
---
## DELLA:
I ain't got time enough to tell you
---
## &nbsp;
the things you don't know.
---
## WAYLAND:
Just start with the basics.
---
## DELLA:
I never slept with Jimmy.
Barely even touched him.
---
## &nbsp;
But in my dreams... in my
dreams it's a different story.
---
## &nbsp;
About a month ago, while
you was out selling,
---
## &nbsp;
the icebox broke. So I
call Jimmy up to help me.
---
## &nbsp;
And it's hot. You know
how hot it get in here.
---
## &nbsp;
So I need my icebox fixed.
---
## &nbsp;
And Jimmy got the back panel out
---
## &nbsp;
and he stuck his head in
to see what the problem is.
---
## &nbsp;
And I see this little, tiny bead of sweat,
---
## &nbsp;
inching its way down the back of his neck.
---
## &nbsp;
Real slow like.
---
## &nbsp;
Almost teasing me.
---
## &nbsp;
And all I can do is just
watch it go down, down, down.
---
## &nbsp;
And then it disappeared behind his collar.
---
## &nbsp;
I never did find out where
that bead of sweat ended up.
---
## &nbsp;
But I sure wanted to.
---
## &nbsp;
I dreamt about that for a whole week.
---
## &nbsp;
Right while I was lying
next to you in this bed,
---
## &nbsp;
I was thinking about him.
---
## &nbsp;
I never wanted to be a bead
of sweat so bad in my life.
---
## WAYLAND:
Are you trying to get that man killed?
---
## &nbsp;
A dream better be all.
---
## DELLA:
What if it ain't? Who's to know?
---
## WAYLAND:
You right.
---
## &nbsp;
It don't matter.
---
## &nbsp;
'Cause you done already
done it in your heart.
---
## DELLA:
You gonna blame me for needing
---
## &nbsp;
what I don't never get from you?
---
## WAYLAND:
That mechanic can't do nothing for you.
---
## DELLA:
Mechanic or not, he's here.
He comes to see about me.
---
## &nbsp;
Person like me could be
laying up in here dead
---
## &nbsp;
and nobody in this big
dirty city would ever know.
---
## WAYLAND:
You ain't never gonna forgive me
---
## &nbsp;
for bringing you here, are you?
---
## &nbsp;
I did the best thing I knew how to do.
---
## &nbsp;
For me. For you. For our family.
---
## DELLA:
We ain't a family,
Wayland. We roommates.
---
## WAYLAND:
Don't say that. This store is my chance.
---
## DELLA:
What about us? Where's our chance?
---
## WAYLAND:
That's what I said.
---
## &nbsp;
This is supposed to be our happiest day.
---
## &nbsp;
We finally gonna get
out of this apartment.
---
## DELLA:
And go where? A bigger apartment?
---
## &nbsp;
Maybe I can have five ovens to bake in!
---
## WAYLAND:
All my life I wanted this, Della.
---
## &nbsp;
And I thought you did too.
---
## DELLA:
I did.
---
## WAYLAND:
And now I finally got it,
---
## &nbsp;
and you standin' here tellin' me-
---
## DELLA:
It's too late!
---
## WAYLAND:
What does that mean?
---
## DELLA:
As long as I known you,
Wayland, you been my rock.
---
## &nbsp;
But now that rock done settled
---
## &nbsp;
at the bottom of my heart and hardened it.
---
## &nbsp;
And I can't be here anymore.
---
## WAYLAND:
If this is about your brother and them,
---
## &nbsp;
now we can make enough money
to bring them all up here.
---
## &nbsp;
We ain't gotta go nowhere for
us to have everything we want.
---
## DELLA:
How would you know what I want?
---
## WAYLAND:
I know how hard things been for you
---
## &nbsp;
with just the two of us.
---
## DELLA:
Stop it.
---
## WAYLAND:
But God saw fit to take our child
---
## &nbsp;
and he didn't give us no more.
---
## DELLA:
I said stop it!
---
## WAYLAND:
And you know my heart
broke for that child, too.
---
## DELLA:
Don't mention him!
---
## WAYLAND:
But it's not my fault.
I didn't kill him.
---
## DELLA:
Yes you did! You did kill him!
---
## WAYLAND:
How dare you say I killed him.
---
## DELLA:
You dragged me on that train.
---
## &nbsp;
If I hadn't gotten on that train-
---
## WAYLAND:
You cannot blame that on me.
---
## DELLA:
I shouldn'ta let you
drag me on that train.
---
## &nbsp;
I shouldn't have let you give up on him.
---
## WAYLAND:
I didn't give up.
---
## DELLA:
Maybe if you cared about that child
---
## &nbsp;
half as much as you
cared about these shoes.
---
## &nbsp;
I'm glad you ain't never had no shop.
---
## &nbsp;
I'm glad you had to carry these shoes
---
## &nbsp;
around with you every day
---
## &nbsp;
so you get just a little bit
---
## &nbsp;
of what I carry around with me.
---
## &nbsp;
Soon as we got up here,
---
## &nbsp;
you threw yourself right into these shoes.
---
## &nbsp;
Child ripped outta my womb,
---
## &nbsp;
I'm s'posed to just keep going
like ain't nothing happen.
---
## &nbsp;
Where are you, huh? Where are ya?
---
## &nbsp;
You off somewhere cutting leather
---
## &nbsp;
and hammering tacks into shoes and shit.
---
## &nbsp;
What I got? A bunch of goddamned pies?
---
## &nbsp;
I broke the sink faucet!
---
## WAYLAND:
What?
---
## DELLA:
I broke it. I broke it on purpose.
---
## WAYLAND:
Why?
---
## DELLA:
I was starting to think...
---
## &nbsp;
I was starting to think
you wasn't coming back.
---
## &nbsp;
And I was losing my mind.
---
## WAYLAND:
How could I not come back?
---
## DELLA:
I don't know. I don't know you no more.
---
## &nbsp;
I don't know me no more.
---
## &nbsp;
Do you remember the
day down in Mississippi
---
## &nbsp;
you found that old piece of wood,
---
## &nbsp;
and you made green paint out
of flour and water and grass
---
## &nbsp;
to make a sign?
---
## WAYLAND:
For my shoe cart.
---
## DELLA:
And we made shoes together.
---
## WAYLAND:
For the baby.
---
## DELLA:
And the azaleas.
---
## &nbsp;
You saved them for me in
the cooler all summer.
---
## WAYLAND:
That's a silly question,
asking me if I remember that.
---
## DELLA:
If I could go someplace
---
## &nbsp;
and live one day over and over
---
## &nbsp;
for the rest of my life,
it would be that day.
---
## &nbsp;
But now the only place I
can go to live that day
---
## &nbsp;
is my dreams.
---
## WAYLAND:
I tried to bring that day back.
---
## &nbsp;
I wanted today to be that day.
---
## DELLA:
I know you did. I know you did.
---
## &nbsp;
But I ain't seen that day
since that day passed.
---
## &nbsp;
And now I'm afraid to go to sleep
---
## &nbsp;
because I know I'm gonna
dream about that day.
---
## &nbsp;
And then I'm gonna wake up
---
## &nbsp;
and know it was all just a dream.
---
## &nbsp;
Do you know what that feel like?
---
## &nbsp;
To have your heart broke
like that every morning?
---
## WAYLAND:
You know what breaks
my heart every morning?
---
## &nbsp;
You.
---
## &nbsp;
I think about you.
---
## &nbsp;
About us. And I get this
feeling in the pit of my stomach
---
## &nbsp;
thinking about everything I ain't become.
---
## &nbsp;
And you deserve so-
---
## DELLA:
Don't tell me what I
do and don't deserve.
---
## &nbsp;
Don't shut me out like that.
---
## &nbsp;
That stuff I said about Jimmy,
I said that to hurt you.
---
## &nbsp;
I never disrespected you with him.
---
## WAYLAND:
But you wanted to.
---
## DELLA:
No. I didn't want to.
---
## &nbsp;
Not unless he could find
some way to turn into you.
---
## WAYLAND:
What you want with the likes of me?
---
## &nbsp;
You just another somebody I done failed.
---
## DELLA:
Wayland, I never asked you for nothing.
---
## WAYLAND:
I know.
---
## DELLA:
Let me finish.
---
## &nbsp;
All these years, I never
asked you for nothing.
---
## &nbsp;
Look at me so I know you hear me.
---
## &nbsp;
All the things you felt
like you had to earn,
---
## &nbsp;
I ain't never been one of 'em.
---
## &nbsp;
You never had to earn me. I been here.
---
## &nbsp;
I'm still here. And you can't even see me.
---
## &nbsp;
I'm drowning and you can't
even see me right here.
---
## WAYLAND:
I don't know how to make that right.
---
## DELLA:
Take me away from here. Take
me back to Sunflower County.
---
## &nbsp;
All we need is eleven dollars
and fifty cents a piece
---
## &nbsp;
and we can leave all this behind.
---
## WAYLAND:
I ain't got that.
---
## DELLA:
You had it earlier today.
Just go get it back and get it.
---
## WAYLAND:
Della, I can't just go back.
---
## DELLA:
Why can't you? Don't you
see what's happenin' to me?
---
## &nbsp;
I'm turning into somebody I don't like.
---
## &nbsp;
Every day, no matter what else happened,
---
## &nbsp;
I knew I could always
look myself in the eye.
---
## &nbsp;
And now I can't even do that.
---
## WAYLAND:
And that's my fault?
---
## DELLA:
It's my fault as much as it is yours.
---
## &nbsp;
But you asking how to
make it right? That's how.
---
## WAYLAND:
I don't know who to be
down there. I don't know-
---
## DELLA:
Neither do I! I haven't
seen Sunflower County
---
## &nbsp;
since I was seventeen.
---
## &nbsp;
But we could figure that out, together.
---
## WAYLAND:
So you 'spect me to just give up?
---
## DELLA:
What is it you giving up?
---
## &nbsp;
You can't take no shoe store
with you to the next life.
---
## &nbsp;
But you could take me.
---
## WAYLAND:
What are you asking me to do?
---
## DELLA:
Give me something. Can you do that?
---
## &nbsp;
Can you bring me back to a place
where I feel like somebody?
---
## WAYLAND:
What about me? Where am
I gonna feel like somebody?
---
## DELLA:
In here. In here.
---
## &nbsp;
Didn't you tell me last night
---
## &nbsp;
that I was holding on
to the best part of you?
---
## &nbsp;
But I'm not enough for you, am I?
---
## WAYLAND:
If I went back,
---
## &nbsp;
if you and me,
---
## &nbsp;
if we went back,
---
## &nbsp;
I don't know how I would
stop myself from hating you.
---
## DELLA:
But you could dream.
---
## &nbsp;
About that day with the
green paint and the azaleas.
---
## WAYLAND:
I ain't like you.
---
## &nbsp;
I can't rely on my dreams
'til real life catch up.
---
## DELLA:
Then what I'm supposed to do, huh?
---
## &nbsp;
If you don't give me
something to hold on to,
---
## &nbsp;
something that ain't made
outta wood and leather,
---
## &nbsp;
I'm not gonna make it.
I'm not gonna make it.
---
## WAYLAND:
Don't make me do this.
---
## DELLA:
I'm not gonna make it, Wayland.
---
## &nbsp;
I'm not gonna make it.
I'm not gonna make it.

hair that wasn't my own
---
## &nbsp;
in a long time.
---
## DELLA:
Can you ever save somebody?
---
## MYRNA:
What you mean?
---
## DELLA:
I am a sad old lady.
---
## MYRNA:
I shouldn'ta said that.
---
## DELLA:
It's true though.
---
## &nbsp;
That man I saw last night,
---
## &nbsp;
I didn't know him.
---
## &nbsp;
How did I ever love him?
---
## MYRNA:
He made your dreams come true.
---
## &nbsp;
When we coming up,
---
## &nbsp;
we get to thinking about what we wish for.
---
## &nbsp;
And we put all those wishes in a box
---
## &nbsp;
and lock that box deep in our heart.
---
## &nbsp;
And then we meet somebody,
---
## &nbsp;
and pray to God that they got the key.
---
## DELLA:
I wanna go home.
---
## &nbsp;
I wanna lay in the tall grass
---
## &nbsp;
with no noise except
the breeze in the trees.
---
## &nbsp;
But I don't know how I'm
supposed to get there.
---
## &nbsp;
All I know is that I'm
stuck with this life,
---
## &nbsp;
with these dreams that wasn't
even mine to begin with.
---
## MYRNA:
I got an idea.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
What time is it?
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
Sunup. We're almost there.
---
## &nbsp;
Did you have a dream last night?
---
## YOUNG DELLA:

## DELLA:

## MYRNA:

---
## DELLA:
Fifty cents a pair is a good deal.
---
## MYRNA:
You mighta set the price,
but I am the saleswoman here.
---
## DELLA:

---
## MYRNA:
For one thing, I'm riding
with you to the train station,
---
## &nbsp;
so we can do all that
mushy gushy stuff there.
---
## &nbsp;
And for another thing,
---
## &nbsp;

---
## &nbsp;
is gonna get rid of me, you
got another thing coming.
---
## &nbsp;
I will be coming down to
Sunflower County to see you.
---
## &nbsp;

## YOUNG WAYLAND:
Fine day for traveling.
---
## DELLA:
I bought a new hat.
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
You leaving a lot behind.
---
## DELLA:
I'm afraid.
---
## &nbsp;
I'm afraid that when I look up,
---
## &nbsp;
I'll see your face in the clouds.
---
## &nbsp;
And when I look down, I'll
see your name in the dust.
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
Now, what is so bad about that?
---
## DELLA:
I been waiting around for you.
---
## &nbsp;
But you don't exist no more.
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
I'm not gone. I'm right
here. Right in front of you.
---
## DELLA:
I, I can't.
---
## WAYLAND:
I ain't gone nowhere.
---
## &nbsp;
Touch me.
---
## &nbsp;
Touch me and see.
---
## DELLA:
You might not be
going nowhere, but I am.
---
## MYRNA:
Della? You think
this cab driver got all day?
---
## &nbsp;
Get the lead outta your ass!
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
It's
the last one on the left.
---
## &nbsp;
We got a good deal on this
place. Snookie know the landlady.
---
## &nbsp;
It's small, I know. But it's ours.
---
## &nbsp;
So, what you think?
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
It's got a window.
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
We only gonna be here
for a little while.
---
## &nbsp;
It's just 'til I open up a place.
---
## &nbsp;
Look. I think the bed fold up.
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
I remember my dream now.
---
## &nbsp;
I dreamed I was on a train.
---
## &nbsp;
The conductor walked by and I
asked him where we were going.
---
## &nbsp;
And he looked down at
me, and he said "home."
---
## &nbsp;
I couldn't recognize him
---
## &nbsp;
but I felt like I knew him my whole life.
---
## &nbsp;
The rules is always different in dreams.
---
## &nbsp;
Anyway, he kept on walking and
I was filled with this joy,
---
## &nbsp;
bubbling up in me like
it was chamomile tea
---
## &nbsp;
and I was the kettle. And I
felt like I was gonna pop.
---
## &nbsp;
And then we came up on this other train
---
## &nbsp;
that was headed in the other direction.
---
## &nbsp;
From where I had just come from.
---
## &nbsp;
And there was a woman,
---
## &nbsp;
sitting by herself, just like me.
---
## &nbsp;
Her eyes was open but she
wasn't looking at nothing.
---
## &nbsp;
And everybody on that train
---
## &nbsp;
was looking back to where they come from.
---
## &nbsp;
Everybody but her.
---
## &nbsp;
And she was old. And tired.
---
## &nbsp;
And then she looked at
me, and I looked at her,
---
## &nbsp;
and then I saw she had azaleas for eyes.
---
## &nbsp;
I wanted her to smile.
But she wouldn't smile.
---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:
And then what?
---
## YOUNG DELLA:
And then I woke up.
---

---
## YOUNG WAYLAND:

---
## YOUNG DELLA:
