Ahhhemmm!

## JOHANNAH:
Greetings Spectators! Right this way, please.
---
## JOHANNAH:

---
## JOHANNAH:
To adjust your volume settings, click on the bar graph icon to adjust the audio level to your liking.

## JOHANNAH:
you can click on the gear icon in the bottom right corner

---
## JOHANNAH:
If you’ve managed to figure out how to view this on your television—congrats to you!
---
## JOHANNAH:
That’s above our paygrade.
---
## JOHANNAH:
The chat and engagement features are fun! We hope you’ll Play along!
---
## JOHANNAH:
Let’s try something now.
---
template: noise
silence
---
## JOHANNAH:
Oh, that WAS fun!
---
## JOHANNAH:
We’ll also share links to post-show “lobby” events here and our program,
---
## JOHANNAH:
your very own digital companion.


---
## JOHANNAH:
If your experience starts to buffer, you can click the pause button in the bottom left corner once
---
## JOHANNAH:
to stop the stream and again to restart.
---
## JOHANNAH:
You can also reload the page if this does not work.
---
## JOHANNAH:
Because this is a live performance coming to you from multiple locations
---
## JOHANNAH:
and because many things such as your broadband provider,
---
## JOHANNAH:
natural disasters, and other acts of god are beyond any of our control,
---
## JOHANNAH:
let’s all just breathe a moment together before we bound forth into the unknown.
---
## JOHANNAH:
Do you have all you need? A tasty beverage? A fancy hat?
---
## JOHANNAH:
Go on, grab your popcorn--we’ll wait.  

---
## JOHANNAH:
There will be one 10 minute intermission.
---
## JOHANNAH:
You can silence your devices at this time….or not…..you won’t bother us.


---
## JOHANNAH:
One final thing before we begin,
---

---
## AMALIA:
You are wondering if I have ever had sexual intercourse.
---
## AMALIA:
Of course.
---
## AMALIA:
If it has occurred to you already, having only just met me,
---
## AMALIA:
don’t you think it would have occurred to someone before you?
---
## AMALIA:
Some man, some time, who would have found it quite easy to find me alone some night?
---
## AMALIA:
Of course.
---
## AMALIA:
Although I have no arms or legs the rest of me is quite normal.
---
## AMALIA:
My face is even beautiful.
---
## AMALIA:
I know this.
---
## AMALIA:
People are not afraid of flattering me or giving me a swelled head,
---
## AMALIA:
because I have no arms or legs.
---
## AMALIA:
They don’t even say it *to* me, really.
---
## AMALIA:
I just hear them as they walk by.
---
## AMALIA:
“MY GOD…SHE’S BEAUTIFUL!”
---
## AMALIA:
they say to each other in varied tones of incredulity.
---
## AMALIA:
How could a freak, they ask themselves, have been blessed with such beauty?
---
## AMALIA:
That is why people are afraid of me.
---
## AMALIA:
I have a lover.
---
## AMALIA:
As a matter of fact.
---
## AMALIA:
A very sweet man.
---
## AMALIA:
He is the man who cleans out the animals’ cages.
---
## AMALIA:
His name is Matthew.
---
## AMALIA:
Good, solid, Biblical name.
---
## AMALIA:
Ran away to join the circus.
---
## AMALIA:
Or, more precisely, Mr. Flip’s Freakshow and Traveling Jungle.
---
## AMALIA:
Matthew said he fell in love with me the minute he saw me, but I think.
---
## AMALIA:
he just made that up later.
---
## AMALIA:
I think he just wanted to get out of that little town.
---
## AMALIA:
But he is in love with me now.
---
## AMALIA:
Every night after he is finished shoveling out the elephant shit, he comes to see me.
---
## AMALIA:
He washes himself thoroughly first.
---
## AMALIA:
I am the only person who gets to see him clean.
---
## AMALIA:
He spends all day in the mud.
---
## AMALIA:
If you were to pass him by when you leave this tent, you would never guess he is my lover.
---
## AMALIA:
He looks just like any other muddy boy during the day, but ah, you must see him at night.
---
## AMALIA:
He parts the curtain and tiptoes into the Hall of Freaks.
---
## AMALIA:
I watch him walking toward me, hair still wet, clean pressed suit, love in his eyes.
---
## AMALIA:
We are silent so as not to wake the others.
---
## AMALIA:
Often the Pinhead is awake anyway, singing little songs to himself.
---
## AMALIA:
Matthew lifts me up and carries me out, back to his bed.
---
## AMALIA:
Pallet of sweet straw in the wagon.
---
## AMALIA:
Listening to the animals settling into their sorrow for the night.
---
## AMALIA:
Sweet good straw and to be off this…*display* for precious moments, held.
---
## AMALIA:
It’s a bit of heaven.
---
## AMALIA:
A small, manageable bit.
---
## AMALIA:
Sometimes he takes me for a walk in the woods at night.
---
## AMALIA:
If the weather is good, sometimes he lays me down and we make love in a field.
---
## AMALIA:
This is exciting because of the danger.
---
## AMALIA:
How would he ever explain it if we got caught?
---
## AMALIA:
It would look pretty bad for him.
---
## AMALIA:
I would never be blamed- I have no arms or legs.
---
## AMALIA:
I think the old farmer who discovered us would have a heart attack and die on the spot.
---
## AMALIA:
Thinking he’d have to chase off a pair of young lovers
---
## AMALIA:
and instead finding a man and a torso.
---
## AMALIA:
You can tell that I am well taken care of.
---
## AMALIA:
My appearance is neat.
---
## AMALIA:
I am properly fed.
---
## AMALIA:
That is all, by the way, because I am beautiful.
---
## AMALIA:
I’ve no doubt that if I were born ugly, I’d have been thrown in a pit before I was five.
---
## AMALIA:
But, as I say, I am well taken care of.
---
## AMALIA:
My hair is brushed.
---
## AMALIA:
My teeth are brushed.
---
## AMALIA:
I am washed.
---
## AMALIA:
I am well taken care of.
---
## AMALIA:
But there are some days, sitting here silent hour after hour being stared at,
---
## AMALIA:
when I would gladly commit murder to be able to scratch my nose.
---
## AMALIA:
Only once have I been taken against my will.
---
## AMALIA:
The night that Matthew sold me.
---
## AMALIA:
It’s actually not a very interesting story.
---
## AMALIA:
I’d rather not go into it.
---
## AMALIA:
Just what you’d think.
---
## AMALIA:
You can fill in the details.
---
## AMALIA:
Rich man in some town we passed through got that idea about me,
---
## AMALIA:
the one we discussed earlier.
---
## AMALIA:
Asked around, the boys shrugged, said, “Ask Matthew.”
---
## AMALIA:
Coincidentally, Matthew and I had fought bitterly the night before about the Pinhead.
---
## AMALIA:
I had hurt him very badly, so Matthew decided to hurt me back.
---
## AMALIA:
He came in and warned me first, though.
---
## AMALIA:
He was crying already.
---
## AMALIA:
When the Rich Man came and took me, I didn’t say a word.
---
## AMALIA:
Didn’t make a sound.
---
## AMALIA:
I could have been the Mute with No Arms and No Legs for all he knew.
---
## AMALIA:
In the end, it was much worse for Matthew.
---
## AMALIA:
He cried at the foot of my pedestal all that night, and for many nights to come.
---
## AMALIA:
It took me a while to forgive him.
---
## AMALIA:
That was really a rotten thing to do, after all.
---
## AMALIA:
I was, uh, very frightened.
---
## AMALIA:
But I was morally in the right, and Matthew was not.
---
## AMALIA:
That’s why it was worse for him.
---
## AMALIA:
He learned something about himself, something he didn’t want to know.
---
## AMALIA:
I certainly would never have guessed it was in him.
---
## AMALIA:
After it happened I knew I shouldn’t have been surprised,
---
## AMALIA:
but I really believed that Matthew was one human being
---
## AMALIA:
without that astounding capacity for cruelty.
---
## AMALIA:
I am in love with the Pinhead.
---
## AMALIA:
That is the tragedy of my life.
---
## AMALIA:
And perhaps it is also the tragedy of the man who cleans out the animals’ cages,
---
## AMALIA:
but I don’t think so.
---
## AMALIA:
He is still young.
---
## AMALIA:
As am I, but I seem much older because I have never moved from this spot.
---
## AMALIA:
Matthew will leave the freakshow, whereas the Pinhead and I will not.
---
## AMALIA:
He is young and filled with belief.
---
## AMALIA:
And love for me.
---
## AMALIA:
Jesus, he practically bursts with it.
---
## AMALIA:
One day he will notice the cruelty of an absent God and he will leave.
---
## AMALIA:
I know the Pinhead has the capacity for sexual intercourse
---
## AMALIA:
because they have to put something in his food
---
## AMALIA:
to keep him from playing with his thing while the audience is here.
---
template: song
## PINHEAD:
La la la la. La la la.
---
## AMALIA:
I love to hear him sing.
---
## AMALIA:
I have never told him of my love because that would break his heart.
---
## AMALIA:
He is neither tall enough to reach me here nor strong enough to carry me.
---
## AMALIA:
If he were aware of the possibilities, he would go mad in his cage.
---
## AMALIA:
I am the only one strong enough to suffer in this love of ours.
---
## AMALIA:
Sometimes we speak.
---
## AMALIA:
I ask him to sing songs for me.
---
## AMALIA:
He likes that.
---
## AMALIA:
He is proud when he remembers things.
---
## AMALIA:
You’ve no idea what it takes not to go mad.
---
## AMALIA:
Many are.
---
## AMALIA:
But I cannot go mad.
---
## AMALIA:
I have responsibilities.
---
## AMALIA:
Oh&#8288;—how rude of me.
---
## AMALIA:
Allow me to introduce my fellow abominations.
---
## AMALIA:
I believe you’ve already met&#8288;—
---
## AMALIA:
The Pinhead…
---
## AMALIA:
Aquaboy, The Human Salamander…
---
## AMALIA:
Kept in water from twelve to fourteen,
---
## AMALIA:
who wouldn’t turn some luminous pale shade of green, eyes growing bigger, breathing slowed?
---
## AMALIA:
More often than not, the water was quite cold.
---
## AMALIA:
Bringing up the blue blush under his translucent skin.
---
## AMALIA:
Like a salamander, shifting blue to green.
---
## AMALIA:
Biggest eyes you’d ever seen.
---
## AMALIA:
After a year in the water, they begun to fleck with gold.
---
## AMALIA:
Bulging beautiful like the eyes of a toad.
---
## AMALIA:
The angle of his neck, head floating on water.
---
## AMALIA:
Everything changed.
---
## AMALIA:
Once you got used to it, it was even colder out than in.
---
## AMALIA:
He’d piss in the water, trying to make it warmer.
---
## AMALIA:
If only for a minute.
---
## AMALIA:
Then drink so he could do it again.
---
## AMALIA:
Eyes green gold above the water, mouth open slightly, taking the water in.
---
## AMALIA:
Warming it for a time on his insides.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
Drain this tank and you pour my soul out on the floor.
---
## AMALIA:
Isn’t he beautiful?
---
## AMALIA:
You’d never guess he showed up here just an undernourished boy
---
## AMALIA:
with a bit of extra skin between fingers and toes.
---
## AMALIA:
Takes an artist to make a transformation like that.
---
## AMALIA:
It takes&#8288;—Mr. Flip.
---
## MR FLIP:
I am not a bad man.
---
## AMALIA:
He always says that.
---
## AMALIA:
Oh, and here is Matthew, on his way to feed the dumber of the beasts in this place.
---
## AMALIA:
He feeds them.
---
## AMALIA:
Waters them.
---
## AMALIA:
Brushes their coats.
---
## AMALIA:
Drags away their shit in buckets.
---
## AMALIA:
And when they die (coughs) he buries their exotic bodies (cough) by the side of the road.
---
template: noise
Amalia has a coughing fit
---
---
## MR FLIP:
I am not a bad man.
---
## MR FLIP:
I know you think I am.
---
## MR FLIP:
You’ve got your minds all set.
---
## MR FLIP:
This is a bad man.
---
## MR FLIP:
He profits from the sale of Freaks.
---
## MR FLIP:
Runs a glorified peepshow for the sick.
---
## MR FLIP:
Exploits these poor freaks who have been deformed by *sin* or *God*.
---
## MR FLIP:
Well, who paid to take a peep, you sick bastards?
---
## MR FLIP:
I know you.
---
## MR FLIP:
You love me and you hate me.
---
## MR FLIP:
You blame me for their deformities because I am the only one standing up here unscathed.
---
## MR FLIP:
It’s as though I somehow caused the pain and suffering and maimed lives
---
## MR FLIP:
just so I could run my fantastic little show.
---
## MR FLIP:
But you also love me because I’m the only one you can look at without looking away.
---
## MR FLIP:
You do not fear me as you fear them, as you fear *being* one of them,
---
## MR.FLIP:
as you fear waking up one of them, drool running out of your mouth,
---
## MR.FLIP:
eyes glazed *but still alive inside*.
---
## MR FLIP:
That really makes you shit, doesn’t it?
---
## MR FLIP:
That’s what you come here for.
---
## MR FLIP:
It’s for the fear.
---
## MR FLIP:
And I am only here to serve *you*.
---
## MATTHEW:
Oh, you don’t really want to hear from me.
---
## MATTHEW:
I’m not smart or beautiful as Amalia is.
---
## MATTHEW:
I’m just the man who cleans out the animals’ cages.
---
## MATTHEW:
I’m just some guy who happens to be the luckiest man in the world.
---
## MATTHEW:
I can’t believe she lets me remain in her presence, even, but that she lets me love her….
---
## MATTHEW:
If you were to kidnap me and take me away from this place
---
## MATTHEW:
and tell me all this never happened, I couldn’t argue with you.
---
## MATTHEW:
I am in love with the most beautiful woman in the world.
---
## MATTHEW:
She won’t let me feed her or brush her hair, but she lets me take her out for walks.
---
## MATTHEW:
She loves the countryside.
---
## MATTHEW:
And I can hold her in my arms that way for hours.
---
## MATTHEW:
She hardly weighs a thing&#8288;—like a baby lamb.
---
## JUDITH:
I feed her.
---
## JUDITH:
I wash her.
---
## JUDITH:
I brush her hair.
---
## JUDITH:
I put it up in the morning, take it down at night.
---
## JUDITH:
I change the little cloths beneath her that time of the month.
---
## JUDITH:
I tend to all aspects of her life.
---
## JUDITH:
I make sure she is the beautiful creature you see.
---
## JUDITH:
She confesses to me.
---
## JUDITH:
After she has heard all the others.
---
## JUDITH:
I hear her private sins.
---
## JUDITH:
Such as?
---
## JUDITH:
you want to know.
---
## JUDITH:
Oh, grave ones.
---
## JUDITH:
Quiet and heavy in her beat-clutching heart.
---
## JUDITH:
She loves the pinhead, who is weak.
---
## JUDITH:
Too weak to hold her.
---
## MR FLIP:
Tell them about the old days.
---
## MR FLIP:
Tell them you were not always so invisible.
---
## MR FLIP:
Used to be the star of the show.
---
## JUDITH:
I never speak unless he gives me permission.
---
## JUDITH:
It’s an old habit.
---
## MR FLIP:
Used to be the star of the show.
---
## JUDITH:
In my nightdress.
---
## MR FLIP:
Ah&#8288;—that’s when nightdresses were nightdresses.
---
## MR FLIP:
When a nightdress meant a certain state of undress.
---
## MR FLIP:
Nowadays a nightdress is apt to be the most decent thing in a woman’s wardrobe,
---
## MR FLIP:
such is the state of bitter turpitude to which we’ve fallen.
---
## JUDITH:
You always talked like that.
---
## JUDITH:
I can’t remember a time when you didn’t talk like that.
---
## MR FLIP:
Tell them about the old days.
---
## MR FLIP:
When you were the star of my show.
---
## JUDITH:
Not now.
---
## AMALIA:
Oh, come now, don’t make us all wait.
---
## JUDITH:
It’s not the time.
---
## JUDITH:
You are beautiful now.
---
## JUDITH:
When you’re older, you’ll learn patience.
---
## AMALIA:
Do you speak to *me* of patience?
---
## JUDITH:
You’re right.
---
## JUDITH:
I’ve no right.
---
## AMALIA:
All right.
---
## PINHEAD:
I *like* Amalia.
---
## PINHEAD:
She is the Woman With No Arms Or Legs for your sins.
---
## AMALIA:
Daniel.
---
## AMALIA:
Would you…sing something for me?
---
## PINHEAD:
What?
---
## AMALIA:
Oh…Lavender?

Neither does Barnum’s.

I could do that.
---
## AMALIA:
I don’t want you to.
---
---
## MR FLIP:
I only pay for babies so their families don’t *think* they’re throwing them away.
---
## MR FLIP:
Oh, it was hard times, too many mouths to feed, we had to sell the freak baby.
---
## MR FLIP:
Sounds better on the conscience than, “*We drowned that thing*.”
---
## MR FLIP:
Originally, I had a man to scour the countryside, looking for freaks, the outlandish,
---
## MR.FLIP:
the physical phenomena lurking away in those backwoods backwater towns.
---
## MR FLIP:
But I had to let the man go because the freaks were coming to me.
---
## MR FLIP:
Or rather the parents were.
---
## MR FLIP:
We heard about you, Mr. Flip sir, and we thought perhaps you’d have a place for our boy.
---
## MR FLIP:
He’s a lovely child, except for his head’s so small.
---
## MR FLIP:
There are those I have to turn away.
---
## MR FLIP:
Not strange enough to pay what it costs me to keep them.

The Human Salamander moans
---
## AMALIA:
You’re quiet tonight, Salamander
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
I’m dead.
---
## AMALIA:
Don’t be silly.
---
## AMALIA:
I can hear you sloshing around.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
Today a…girl came to the show.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
She saw me.
---
## AMALIA:
That’s what we’re here for.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
*No*. _Saw_ me.
---
## AMALIA:
Oh.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
She did not see a marvel of nature.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
An amphibian man.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
She saw _me_.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
Run away from home and sitting in a tank of water.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
I’d almost forgotten.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
You really start to believe your own press.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
You have to.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
Without pride…well, they wouldn’t pay, is all.
---
## AMALIA:
I’m sorry. I forget&#8288;—
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
Yes, no one doubts your credentials.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
I am a mutation.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
That means _change_.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
Changed.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
And I have mutated.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
Into this half-human creature.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
Because just a bit of skin between the fingers and toes is fine for back home
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
but it doesn’t keep the crowd leaning in for a glimpse.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
So I became the Human Salamander.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
Until she saw me.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
Staring eyes.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
Burning.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
The Human Salamander does not blush.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
The intricate network of veins and capillaries
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
works differently than in ordinary humans.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
But there it was.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
I felt my skin growing hot.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
Under her gaze.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
How could she see me?
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
Inside my guise?
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
If it’s happened once, it could happen again.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
That show could come when suddenly, an entire audience sees me.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
Some skinny kid bloated with water.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
Sad.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
An entire audience suddenly overcome with revulsion and…pity.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
Now I know fear.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
She has ruined my life.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
A wandering pair of eyes, set the lie to the whole thing.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
She’s cracked my tank.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
I won’t notice the water level sinking slow,
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
just one day will come and I’ll be naked.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
She doesn’t even know what she’s done.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
A day trip, idle staring.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
One moment of recognition&#8288;—oh, that poor kid.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
He’s about my age.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
Sitting there in a tank of water all day while people stare.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
Then moving on to see the other marvels.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
Then home.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
Cracked my tank and went about her *life*.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
Left me here to leak.
---
## AMALIA:
Salamander&#8288;—
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
She was pretty.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
I was…staring at her first.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
That’s how come I noticed.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
That she…saw me.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
Usually I can stare at whoever I please.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
One advantage of the tank.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
No one notices.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
They think I’m waiting to catch a fly.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
Hardest part of the job, learning how to do that.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
I had to practice for six months after the people had gone
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
before I could do it in front of them.
---
## AMALIA:
You’d never guess you weren’t born to it.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
But this time…burned.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
Her eyes burned.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
Because she caught me.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
She saw _me_.
---
## AMALIA:
It’ll never happen again.
---
## AMALIA:
She’ll never come back.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
I know.
---
---
## MR FLIP:
Why do you want to hear it again?
---
## AMALIA:
I don’t know.
---
## AMALIA:
It makes me feel strange.
---
## MR FLIP:
She fell in the river.
---
## AMALIA:
And she could not kick or swim or grab her way to safety?
---
## MR FLIP:
Hit her head on a rock.
---
## AMALIA:
How long had you been married?
---
## MR FLIP:
Four years.
---
## AMALIA:
No children?
---
## MR FLIP:
God didn’t see fit to bless us.
---
## AMALIA:
She did something, didn’t she? To make sure?
---
## MR FLIP:
Do you know, I don’t honestly know.
---
## MR FLIP:
I can’t say I knew that woman’s heart and soul, much as I loved her.
---
## AMALIA:
Were her arms very beautiful?
---
## MR FLIP:
Yes.
---
---
## MATTHEW:
And I heard of another place so cold they live in snow.
---
## MATTHEW:
Blocks of snow piled up to give shelter from the wind.
---
## MATTHEW:
Everything they wear is the skins of animals,
---
## MATTHEW:
so they look like great furry beasts themselves.
---
## JUDITH:
Yes. I saw them once.
---
## JUDITH:
Laplanders, they were called.
---
## MATTHEW:
How can you live in snow?
---
## JUDITH:
Oh, I don’t know if they really live in snow.
---
## MATTHEW:
They pack the snow very hard, is what I heard.
---
## JUDITH:
Still. How would it stay up?
---
## MATTHEW:
I don’t know…we used to build snow fortresses&#8288;—
---
## JUDITH:
That’s walls, yes? Not a roof.
---
## MATTHEW:
No, but&#8288;—
---
## JUDITH:
And then do they light a fire inside?
---
## JUDITH:
And melt their house?
---
## MATTHEW:
Maybe there’s&#8288;—
---
## JUDITH:
No fire?
---
## MATTHEW:
Yes.
---
## JUDITH:
On a vast plain of snow and ice?
---
## JUDITH:
They would die.
---
## JUDITH:
These Laplanders were human beings, not beasts.
---
## JUDITH:
Not so different from you and me.
---
## MATTHEW:
Perhaps not outwardly, but with a different interior circulatory system,
---
## MATTHEW:
different physical requirements for life and breath&#8288;—
---
## JUDITH:
Matthew. You must stop believing in everything.
---
## MATTHEW:
Still.
---
## MATTHEW:
I would like to see it for myself.
---
## MATTHEW:
Great plains of snow and ice.
---
## MATTHEW:
Jungles filled with singing frogs and monkeys.
---
## MATTHEW:
Pygmies I would not have believed had I not seen them with my own eyes.
---
## MATTHEW:
They are true enough.
---
## JUDITH:
Yes, certainly. True enough.
---
## MATTHEW:
Singing frogs. They say.
---
## MATTHEW:
Not like ours.
---
## MATTHEW:
They stick to the trees, climb right up the side.
---
## MATTHEW:
Can you imagine the heat and the green and a jungle full of singing frogs&#8288;—
---
## AMALIA:
Just go.
---
## MATTHEW:
I don’t want to go.
---
## AMALIA:
Yes. Yes, you do.

Hit me.

It’d feel good, wouldn’t it?

Wouldn’t it feel just wonderful to release that fist from its coiled spring?

## MR FLIP:
But you won’t.

Because I’d fire you.

And then you couldn’t be around *her*.

And then where would you be?

If you were not in her presence?

It is not good business for me to care.

Ah. The last word.

Not so last as it used to be.

You do not fire him because&#8288;—

Because I do not care.

&#8288;—because if you fire him, she will love him forever.

You always had&#8288;—

Wisdom beyond your years.

It’s true.

I live in this tank.

We’re not fakes here.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
You can report back to all the kiddies in town.

Maybe the reception will be better when we pass through next year.

Kiddies?

You’re no older than I am.

You know what I mean.

I’ll be whipped if I’m caught sneaking out.

The least you could do is act glad to see me.

Don’t you remember me?

Yes.

It was just this afternoon.

That I…

…fell in love with you.

You must have known.

My god, I felt transparent.

## THE GIRL:
When I saw you were looking at me.

Seeing me.

## THE GIRL:
Looking at you.

## THE GIRL:
My love stupid all over my face.

My face went hot.

I was so ashamed I had to walk on.

You&#8288;—

But I kept thinking about you.

All day.

I didn’t see anything else here.

No matter what I stood in front of.

All I could see was you.

I should take a look around, now that I’m back.

Farm girls sneak away from their homes in every town you pass through,

just to pay homage at your tank.

## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
No&#8288;—

## THE GIRL:
Run away with me.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
What?
---
## THE GIRL:
You’ve done it before.
---
## THE GIRL:
Had to run from somewhere to end up here.
---
## THE GIRL:
Run again.
---
## THE GIRL:
Only this time, with me.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
I…can’t leave this tank.
---
## THE GIRL:
You don’t think I&#8288;—
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
I couldn’t breathe.
---
## THE GIRL:
I’m not a rube, you know.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
I…couldn’t breathe.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
I *sit* in a tank of water
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
because otherwise my delicate amphibious skin would parch and crack.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
The gills&#8288;—see them?&#8288;—need to be kept moist or I could not breathe.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
Being a half-human mutation, I breathe through lungs and gills.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
But the one system would be insufficient without the other.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
Just as I cannot fully breathe when completely submerged in water,
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
so I cannot fully breathe when completely out of the water.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
The one system of breathing supports the other.
---
## THE GIRL:
Isn’t the water cold?
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
No. The air…is cold.

I want to kiss you.

So. You have discovered his gills.
---
## AMALIA:
He’s not gaffed.

They’re real.

We wouldn’t have put them on him, anyway.

Everybody knows salamanders don’t have gills.

So he was&#8288;—

## AMALIA:
No, he wasn’t born with them.

He grew them.

## AMALIA:
Here.

## AMALIA:
She *is* pretty.

## THE GIRL:
You told her about me?

Then you did notice me!

Come away with me!

## AMALIA:
Do you want to, Tom?

I can’t.

Didn’t you hear?

Young woman…

Are you truly prepared to run away?

## THE GIRL:
Yes.

## AMALIA:
Leave behind those who love you?

## THE GIRL:
Begging your pardon, that’s not what’s involved.
---
## AMALIA:
Have you ever run away before?
---
## THE GIRL:
No ma’am.
---
## THE GIRL:
I aim to do it once and do it right.

## AMALIA:
If you’ve never run away before, you can’t know what’s involved, the difficulty, the fear&#8288;—

I f I said I’d done it before you’d have said I’d just turn around and go home again.

Can you cook?

Yes.

All right. You can stay.

I&#8288;— I&#8288;—

Really?

## AMALIA:
I’ll talk to him.

## AMALIA:
Go to Judith. She’ll hide you till then.
---
## THE GIRL:
Thank you!

## AMALIA:
Beware of her, Salamander.
---
## AMALIA:
Anyone who tries to steal you from your home…
---
## AMALIA:
…is evil or an idiot, or both.

## AMALIA:
You know where she comes from.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
Yes.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
Why did you do that?
---
## AMALIA:
What?
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
Say she could stay?
---
## AMALIA:
I was afraid you’d go after her.
---
## AMALIA:
We’d find you asphyxiated half a mile down the road.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
I wouldn’t have gone.
---
## AMALIA:
Mmm.
---
## AMALIA:
And you’d have wished you had.
---
## AMALIA:
This way you can observe her.
---
## AMALIA:
Get to know who she really is.
---
## AMALIA:
So that when she leaves, you won’t be sorry.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
Oh.
---
## AMALIA:
But you must learn to breathe again, Salamander.
---
## AMALIA:
Autonomy is not a thing to be given up for comfort.

## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
It’ll be nice having her around for a while.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
I’m not in love with her, though.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
I don’t think.

## AMALIA:
Just a stomachache?

Yes.

So. Has it crossed your mind yet?

## AMALIA:
Don’t tell me it hasn’t.

To have me.

## AMALIA:
While I have no arms and legs, the muscles of my interior regions are unbelievably strong.

Did it occur to you to wonder what I do up here on this perch all day long?
---
## AMALIA:
I do my strengthening exercises.
---
## AMALIA:
Tighten and release my interior muscles.

## AMALIA:
Thousands of times a day.

## AMALIA:
Matthew could tell you things…

## AMALIA:
Oh, but he never would.

Not under pain of torture.

He would never speak ill of me.
---
## AMALIA:
He loves me.
---
## AMALIA:
And now you know why.
---
## AMALIA:
I can clench a cock so tight you couldn’t pull it out.
---
## AMALIA:
Sometimes I can even make myself come.
---
## AMALIA:
If I get my weight positioned just right.

But then, I have hours.

Eyes staring rips through my skin.

## AMALIA:
It makes me laugh.

That they don’t know what I’m doing with my precious anatomy.
---
## AMALIA:
This strange perhaps funny gift of god.
---
## AMALIA:
Does he laugh?
---
## AMALIA:
Does he think, Finally.
---
## AMALIA:
I have created the perfect woman.
---
## AMALIA:
I never take it in my mouth.
---
## AMALIA:
I think that’s disgusting.
---
## AMALIA:
I know there are those that do, but I myself think that is disgusting.
---
## AMALIA:
A mouth is for kissing.

## AMALIA:
And were you to kiss me, on my mouth, on my warm pink open mouth,
---
## AMALIA:
you would become intoxicated.
---
## AMALIA:
Kissing me, you would become intoxicated.
---
## AMALIA:
And after that, after one kiss or two, you could not fail
---
## AMALIA:
to be so intoxicated by my kisses that you would have to lift my skirt.
---
## AMALIA:
No fear of what lies under could match the passion of my soft warm breath.
---
## AMALIA:
My tongue, inside my teeth.
---
## AMALIA:
Inside my mouth.
---
## AMALIA:
You would need, at least, to put your hand beneath my skirt.
---
## AMALIA:
And once your fingers find what they seek you would find, “Yes, she is like other women.
---
## AMALIA:
She is like all other women.” And you would not be afraid.
---
## AMALIA:
I never take it in my mouth because that is disgusting.
---
## AMALIA:
And because rules are important.
---
## AMALIA:
Some…modicum of control…is important.
---
## AMALIA:
There’s a new girl.
---
## MR FLIP:
We don’t need anyone.
---
## AMALIA:
I want her here.
---
## MR FLIP:
Good lord, woman, we can’t just go around picking up strays.
---
## MR FLIP:
I’m running a business, here.
---
## AMALIA:
I’ll quit.
---
## AMALIA:
Walk away from my whole career.
---
## MR FLIP:
Does she cook?
---
## AMALIA:
Yes.
---
## MR FLIP:
Can she sell tickets?
---
## AMALIA:
A head for figures and a figure that turns heads.
---
## MR FLIP:
All right.
---
## MR FLIP:
You’ve got your pet.
---
## MR FLIP:
As if I could deny you anything you want.
---
## MR FLIP:
I’m sick of Matthew’s Anything Chowder, anyway.
---
## MR FLIP:
Don’t know why you think you can order me around.
---
## MR FLIP:
There’s a human torso in England who paints miniatures, you know.
---
## AMALIA:
So hire her, if you can afford her fees.
---
## MR FLIP:
Hmmm.
---
## MR FLIP:
She is, I’ve heard, rather unusually plain.
---
## AMALIA:
That looks good.
---
## MR FLIP:
It is.
---
## MR FLIP:
Shall I send Judith to get one for you?
---
## AMALIA:
Yes.
---
## AMALIA:
What was she like, his wife?
---
## AMALIA:
Was she nice?
---
## JUDITH:
Nice not the word I’d use.
---
## JUDITH:
She was always good to me.
---
## AMALIA:
What was she called?
---
## JUDITH:
Bet.
---
## JUDITH:
She was a good, sensible woman.
---
## JUDITH:
Liked animals better than people.
---
## JUDITH:
Guess that’s why we got on so good.
---
## AMALIA:
You were friends?
---
## JUDITH:
We got on.
---
## JUDITH:
Used to stay up later than anyone.
---
## JUDITH:
Watch the fire bum down to coals.
---
## JUDITH:
Sometimes talk.
---
## JUDITH:
Sometimes not.
---
## AMALIA:
Did she do something?
---
## AMALIA:
So as not to have a baby?
---
## JUDITH:
Yeah.
---
## JUDITH:
I showed her. Which plants to use.
---
## JUDITH:
After my Grandmother showed me.
---
## JUDITH:
My mother said, “What ya tellin her that for? She’s not gonna need it.”
---
## JUDITH:
Ha. I’ve had more men than she has, that’s for sure.
---
## AMALIA:
And did she…
---
## AMALIA:
Did she mean to do it, do you think?
---
## AMALIA:
Disappear beneath the water and never come up?
---
## JUDITH:
I don’t know.
---
## JUDITH:
I didn’t know all her secrets.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
Where you&#8288;—?
---
## THE GIRL:
Kitchen. Wanna&#8288;—?
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
Can’t.

Right.

template: noise
Judith growls
---
## THE GIRL:
I’ll see you later, then.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
Yeah.
---
## THE GIRL:
What do you make?
---
## THE GIRL:
What do they like?
---
## MATTHEW:
Chowder, generally.
---
## THE GIRL:
Chowder? Of what?
---
## MATTHEW:
Beef. Corn. Crawdads.
---
## MATTHEW:
Depends where we are.
---
## THE GIRL:
And that’s the Circus Favorite?
---
## MATTHEW:
Well, we haven’t got much money to spare for fancy *ingreedymints*.
---
## MATTHEW:
Depends what’s cheap at the market.
---
## THE GIRL:
Well, there’s always biscuits and gravy.
---
## THE GIRL:
Can make that from next to nothing.
---
## THE GIRL:
Or is everybody sick of biscuits?
---
## MATTHEW:
Uh, no.
---
## MATTHEW:
I don’t make biscuits.
---
## THE GIRL:
Your mama never taught you to make biscuits?
---
## MATTHEW:
She never taught me how to make chowder, neither.
---
## MATTHEW:
I…don’t even know if it is chowder, really.
---
## MATTHEW:
I just…made it up.
---
## MATTHEW:
It’s not exactly soup, right?
---
## MATTHEW:
More hearty.
---
## THE GIRL:
I bet it’s wonderful.
---
## MATTHEW:
Well, I was gettin’ better.
---
## MATTHEW:
They’re never gonna need you like you want them to, you know.
---
## MATTHEW:
There’s a thousand *thousand* like you.
---
## MATTHEW:
You’ll always be replaceable.
---
## THE GIRL:
Naw. Not like me.
---
## MATTHEW:
That’s what I thought, too.
---
## MATTHEW:
Till I saw the spittin’ image of me walk in here every third town we pass through.
---
## MATTHEW:
Jaw droppin’ to the floor, eyes all over everything, tryin’ to memorize.
---
## THE GIRL:
Well, I don’t want them all to need me.
---
## THE GIRL:
Just him.
---
## MATTHEW:
He’ll never leave.
---
## THE GIRL:
Yeah, he will.
---
## MATTHEW:
This is where he lives.
---
## THE GIRL:
He’ll leave it for me.
---
## MATTHEW:
You really wanna do that?
---
## MATTHEW:
Dry him out?
---
## MATTHEW:
Keep him all to yourself?
---
## THE GIRL:
I think I can take it from here.
---
## THE GIRL:
Less there’s anything else you need to show me.
---
## MATTHEW:
Naw.
---
## MATTHEW:
I guess you gotta learn it for yourself, anyway.
---
## MATTHEW:
Maybe you’re just…better suited to the job than I ever was.
---
## MATTHEW:
Maybe you’ll do just fine.
---
## MATTHEW:
Since when can’t we show on a Sunday?
---
## MR FLIP:
One of the fascinating things about rules, Matthew:
---
## MR FLIP:
their ever-changing, ever-twisting, shimmering permutations.
---
## MATTHEW:
What’s that supposed to mean?
---
## MR FLIP:
Almost nineteen hundred years after his death and incontrovertible resurrection,
---
## MR FLIP:
Jesus himself has whispered in some local deacon’s ear that our little show is a sin.
---
## MR FLIP:
A sin and a shame.

## MR FLIP:
Sunday was our biggest day.
---
## MR FLIP:
Back in the day.
---
## MR FLIP:
Remember, my dear?
---
## MR FLIP:
When a Sunday meant crowds packed in sweat tight?
---
## MR FLIP:
As many shows as we could fit into a day?
---
## JUDITH:
We put the fear a God into ‘em.
---
## JUDITH:
Better than any church.
---
## MATTHEW:
With the Dog Girl routine?
---
## MR FLIP:
Routine, he says.
---
## MR FLIP:
She *was* the Dog-Faced Girl.
---
## MR FLIP:
Tell him, Jude.
---
## AMALIA:
Yes, now is it time for the terrible tale?
---
## JUDITH:
I don’t know&#8288;—
---
## AMALIA:
Please…
---
## JUDITH:
All right, then.
---
## JUDITH:
I was, I was the ugly mug with the Harelip.
---
## JUDITH:
But Mr. Flip saw I was blooming.
---
## JUDITH:
About to burst…out.
---
## JUDITH:
Ugly mug attached to sweet…ness.
---
## JUDITH:
Sweet ripe flesh.
---
## JUDITH:
Down on all fours in the dirt.
---
## JUDITH:
I was one of the last ones he bought.
---
## JUDITH:
After they was comin’ after him from all the villages, sayin’ Mr. Flip, take the deformity.
---
## JUDITH:
Make you good money.
---
## JUDITH:
Here, take.
---
## JUDITH:
Take the freak baby in the magic glamor caravan
---
## JUDITH:
so we never have to look at the sin we’ve spawned.
---
## JUDITH:
What sin spawned.
---
## JUDITH:
The sick.
---
## JUDITH:
Please.
---
## JUDITH:
Look what a freak.
---
## JUDITH:
Make you good money.
---
## JUDITH:
Make you good money, Mr. Flip.
---
## JUDITH:
And he saw me.
---
## JUDITH:
Sweeping up in the corner.
---
## JUDITH:
Me, he had to pay for.
---
## JUDITH:
They didn’t want to let me go.
---
## JUDITH:
Had all my limbs fine.
---
## JUDITH:
Just the split lip just the face like an animal.
---
## JUDITH:
Nevergetermarriedoff, but she works just fine.
---
## JUDITH:
Ugly mug but she’s a strong ’un.
---
## JUDITH:
Mr. Flip said, “I’ll pay.” Saw he’d soon get a return.
---
## JUDITH:
Soon be getting a return on his investment.
---
## MR FLIP:
You were the most beautiful creature I had ever seen.
---
## JUDITH:
No, you ain’t getting away with that
---
## MR FLIP:
I am not saying I am a good man.
---
## JUDITH:
He always comes on romantic about things past.
---
## JUDITH:
It was ugly being there.
---
## JUDITH:
It was black and ugly.
---
## MR FLIP:
I am merely saying that you were the most beautiful creature I had ever seen.
---
## JUDITH:
I knew&#8288;—
---
## JUDITH:
I thought I knew&#8288;—
---
## JUDITH:
He thought I was pretty.
---
## JUDITH:
That he was the only one saw me pretty.
---
## MR FLIP:
Pretty is cheap and useless.
---
## MR FLIP:
You were the stuff of saints.
---
## JUDITH:
I knew when men put up money like that, they thought you was pretty.
---
## JUDITH:
Don’t ask how I knew, half-animal, sweeping up in the corner.
---
## JUDITH:
I’d seen, I’d heard.
---
## JUDITH:
I’d seen the way he looked at me.
---
## JUDITH:
He thought I was pretty.
---
## JUDITH:
So he bought and paid for me.
---
## JUDITH:
And the world was
---
## JUDITH:
changing.
---
## JUDITH:
Then he threw me in the cellar.
---
## MR FLIP:
Perfection does not grow wild.
---
## JUDITH:
Threw me in the cellar with my friend.
---
## JUDITH:
Her name was (barks).
---
## JUDITH:
Haurt.
---
## JUDITH:
my friend.
---
## JUDITH:
My only companion.
---
## JUDITH:
No human contact, no speech, fed from the same dish on the floor.
---
## JUDITH:
Six months, nine?
---
## JUDITH:
A year?
---
## JUDITH:
Meat scraps and dirt.
---
## JUDITH:
Slept curled together for warmth.
---
## JUDITH:
No one had ever loved me like that.
---
## JUDITH:
She would have killed anyone who tried to harm me.
---
## JUDITH:
She told me so.
---
## JUDITH:
*Aourt howt houuuuu*.
---
## JUDITH:
When I was sick and almost dying, she chewed the meat for me and put it in my mouth.
---
## JUDITH:
My own mother would not have&#8288;—did not know how to love a child like that.
---
## JUDITH:
And when he had me tempered in the forge, when he’d made me her child,
---
## JUDITH:
when it was time to put me in the cage, he kicked her out onto the streets.
---
## JUDITH:
She came howling, following my cage from town to town.
---
## MR FLIP:
How else would they have believed that I’d rescued you from a pack of wild dogs?
---
## JUDITH:
Rescued me.
In my filthy outgrown nightdress.
---
## MR FLIP:
Ah, yes. The nightdress.
---
## JUDITH:
More rips than dress.
---
## JUDITH:
Caged up, men starin’ down at me.
---
## JUDITH:
I’d see the sick thing swelling in their drawers.
---
## JUDITH:
And me, and me down on all fours.
---
## JUDITH:
I’d sniff over to him givin’ the evil eye and I’d set up a howlin’
---
## JUDITH:
*AAAAOOOOOUUUUUU*.
---
## JUDITH:
Then you’d see ‘em shrink and quiver, yes
---
## JUDITH:
Then you’d see a True Believer.
---
## JUDITH:
Scared on back to wife and kinder.
---
## JUDITH:
Never see her in her nightdress with the light on.
---
## JUDITH:
Never see her down.
---
## JUDITH:
In the dirt.
---
## JUDITH:
Gotta pay to see a woman debased.
---
## JUDITH:
With her ass in yer face.
---
## JUDITH:
Licensed, like.
---
## JUDITH:
It’s all right.
---
## JUDITH:
Gotta pay to see a woman down.
---
## JUDITH:
In the dirt.
---
## JUDITH:
Course you could just knock down the one you got.
---
## JUDITH:
Many do.
---
## JUDITH:
There’s lots do that.
---
## JUDITH:
Knock the one you got in the dirt.
---
## JUDITH:
In front of God and Kinder.
---
## JUDITH:
All in all, this is easier.
---
## JUDITH:
A woman so ugly you can’t look her in the face.
---
## JUDITH:
You can’t help but look her in the face.
---
## JUDITH:
Can’t help but stare.
---
## JUDITH:
“GOD, SHE’S UGLY,”
---
## JUDITH:
and all that beauty down below.
---
## JUDITH:
Swollen pink and white and muddy.
---
## JUDITH:
What’s that?
---
## JUDITH:
Glimpsed a bit through her nightie.
---
## JUDITH:
Sure, that’s a nip.
---
## JUDITH:
Godawmighty, what an ugly.
---
## JUDITH:
What a beauty.
---
## JUDITH:
It starts stiffing in their pants and I come a howling.
---
## JUDITH:
Dog girl can sniff out sin in ye pockets.
---
## MR FLIP:
It was a good act.
---
## JUDITH:
Act, he says.
---
## MR FLIP:
We could stay two weeks in one spot.
---
## MR FLIP:
Word spread like grease fire.
---
## MR FLIP:
Men walking miles, pockets heavy with coin.
---
## MR FLIP:
Two weeks in one spot!
---
## MATTHEW:
How can you&#8288;—
---
## MATTHEW:
How can you look another human being in the face, you&#8288;—you&#8288;—
---
## MR FLIP:
I made her. Created her.
---
## MATTHEW:
How can you&#8288;—
---
## JUDITH:
He did.
---
## AMALIA:
Can’t you leave him alone?

Had enough.
---
## JUDITH:
Then came the accident and I saw him drown like she had, but inside himself.
---
## JUDITH:
You could hardly tell it was the same man.
---
## JUDITH:
He looked just the same, only he wasn’t there.
---
## JUDITH:
I’d seen him look at her and there was boy in him, in his eyes and his face,
---
## JUDITH:
and now that was all gone there was old man taken over.
---
## JUDITH:
So I couldn’t leave him just then.
---
## JUDITH:
Wait till he could take care of himself again.
---
## JUDITH:
And the rest.
---
## JUDITH:
By then there was more to worry about than just me.
---
## JUDITH:
Everyone depending on me to bring ‘em in.
---
## JUDITH:
Then one day and he came home with you.
---
## JUDITH:
The minute I saw you, I loved you.
---
## JUDITH:
Little thing that you were.
---
## JUDITH:
I knew.
---
## JUDITH:
Now I was free.
---
## JUDITH:
I could get out of the cage.
---
## JUDITH:
I thought I’ll just stay and help her adjust.
---
## JUDITH:
Three weeks or so.
---
## JUDITH:
Then I’ll be gone.
---
## JUDITH:
You lookin’ brave as hell and scareder than that.
---
## JUDITH:
Three weeks, I said.
---
## JUDITH:
Been the longest three weeks I ever heard of.
---
## AMALIA:
Oh, it hasn’t been three weeks…
---
## JUDITH:
No, I suppose not yet.
---
---
## MATTHEW:
She doesn’t have to do this, you know.
---
## MATTHEW:
She’s one of the smartest people I’ve ever met.
---
## MATTHEW:
Could do anything she set her mind to, I believe.
---
## MATTHEW:
I’m sure she’d know how to read, except for the turning the pages.
---
## MATTHEW:
I could turn them for her.
---
## MATTHEW:
But she doesn’t like you to do things for her.
---
## AMALIA:
You must do something about the weather, sir.
---
## AMALIA:
At the next spot I’d like a bit more rain.
---
## AMALIA:
This dust is irritating.
---
## MR FLIP:
I’ll speak to the authorities.
---
## AMALIA:
That looks good.
---
## MR FLIP:
It is. Shall I send&#8288;—
---
## AMALIA:
Can I have a bite?
---
## MR FLIP:
Of course.
---
## AMALIA:
Thank you.
---
## MR FLIP:
Another?
---
## AMALIA:
Yes.
---
## MR FLIP:
This is nonsense.
---
## MR FLIP:
We’ve already paid twice what we paid last year, for half as many days.
---
## TOUGH:
That was rent on the spot.
---
## TOUGH:
You didn’t pay to make sure you don’t  have any kind of problems.
---
## MR FLIP:
We’ve never had problems here.
---
## TOUGH:
You do now.
---

blows landing, grunts of pain
---
---
## JUDITH:
How long ya gonna keep this up?
---
## MR FLIP:
For…ever.
---
## JUDITH:
We barely pull in enough to feed them anymore.
---
## MR FLIP:
And *what* would you have me *do*?
---
## JUDITH:
Cut ’em loose.
---
## MR FLIP:
Judith! You know what it’s like out there.
---
## JUDITH:
They would learn.
---
## MR FLIP:
Judith…
---
## JUDITH:
She’s a draw.
---
## JUDITH:
The rest aren’t pulling their weight and you know it.
---
## MR FLIP:
What do you propose I do with the Pinhead?
---
## MR FLIP:
Leave him on the church steps in a basket?
---
## JUDITH:
He knows all the hymns.
---
## MR.FLIP:
If by some miracle these *were* good Christian people who didn’t stone him or beat him out of fear
---
## MR.FLIP:
or chase him into the woods to live like an animal,
---
## MR.FLIP:
if they decided to let him live in a small room at the back of the church
---
## MR.FLIP:
and sing hymns in a voice that makes the angels cry,
---
## MR.FLIP:
*he would be treated with revulsion and pity the rest of his life*.
---
## JUDITH:
The Salamander can make his own way.
---
## MR FLIP:
Judith, the boy grew gills.
---
## MR FLIP:
He grew gills…for me.
---
## MR FLIP:
Out of fright.
---
## MR FLIP:
Because he thought he might be let go.
---
## JUDITH:
I used to think you were a good businessman.
---
## JUDITH:
Now I know it was just a good time for the exhibition of freaks.
---
## JUDITH:
And any fool could have made a go of it.
---
---
## AMALIA:
Sometimes I wish I had a cage.
---
## AMALIA:
When I can feel what they’re thinking.
---
## AMALIA:
Looking at me.
---
## AMALIA:
Breathing through their mouths.
---
## AMALIA:
Crowding close, dangerous many of them.
---
## AMALIA:
I can feel their thoughts.
---
## AMALIA:
Sometimes I hear something straight from a man’s mind and I blush and look down.
---
## AMALIA:
That is the worst humiliation.
---
## AMALIA:
My long swan-neck bent.
---
## AMALIA:
Because if they can see that…if they can see that I am not impervious.
---
## AMALIA:
I can be affected.
---
## AMALIA:
They will realize.
---
## AMALIA:
Someday.
---
## AMALIA:
One will realize that he could reach out…with his hand…and touch me.
---
## AMALIA:
Then my heart beats hammers in my chest and my eyes dart.
---
## AMALIA:
Only by superhuman effort do I retain my cold look, just over their heads.
---
## AMALIA:
And another day goes by that it does not occur to anyone.
---
## AMALIA:
To reach.
---
## AMALIA:
To grab.
---
## AMALIA:
For weeks after, I long for iron bars.
---
## AMALIA:
To keep them out.
---
---
## MR FLIP:
How’s my angel?
---
## AMALIA:
What happened to your eye?
---
## MR FLIP:
Oh, nothing. Just a bit of a territorial dispute.
---
## MR FLIP:
They sought to displace us,
---
## MR FLIP:
I was forced to call upon my more pugilistic nature to prevent them.
---
## AMALIA:
So it’s all right?
---
## MR FLIP:
Of course, it’s all right.
---
## MR FLIP:
We got some oranges.
---
## MR FLIP:
Shall I peel you one?
---
## AMALIA:
I’m not hungry.
---
## MR FLIP:
A pear?
---
## MR FLIP:
It won’t be good by tomorrow.
---
## MR FLIP:
The flesh gives just slightly to the touch.
---
## MR FLIP:
It’s perfect, lightly freckled skin like&#8288;—
---
## AMALIA:
All right. Like what?
---
## MR FLIP:
What?
---
## AMALIA:
Skin like&#8288;—What were you going to say?
---
## MR FLIP:
Like your own.
---
## AMALIA:
Mm. I thought so.
---
---
## MATTHEW:
How could you?
---
## MATTHEW:
From his hand.
---
## MATTHEW:
FEEDING FROM HIS HAND!
---
## AMALIA:
Careful, Matthew, he’s got a knife.
---
## MATTHEW:
A fruit knife.
---
## AMALIA:
Mr. Flip.
---
## MR FLIP:
Yes?
---
## AMALIA:
Will you please leave us?
---
## AMALIA:
We have things to discuss.
---
## MR FLIP:
Of course.
---
## MATTHEW:
Never&#8288;—you would never take food from my hand.
---
## AMALIA:
Matthew&#8288;—
---
## MATTHEW:
Why?
---
## MATTHEW:
Why would you never take food from my hand?
---
## AMALIA:
You know why.
---
## MATTHEW:
Judith only.
---
## MATTHEW:
You always said Judith only.
---
## MATTHEW:
And the hair, and the…
---
## MATTHEW:
Not even a drink of water…would you take from my hand.
---
## AMALIA:
Matthew&#8288;—
---
## MATTHEW:
Come away with me.
---
## MATTHEW:
Come away from this wicked place.
---
## MATTHEW:
Let me take you away.
---
## MATTHEW:
You don’t have to do this&#8288;—
---
## AMALIA:
Matthew&#8288;—
---
## MATTHEW:
I can support us easy.
---
## MATTHEW:
Able-bodied. Lots of things I could do.
---
## MATTHEW:
Let me take you away from this evil and shame.
---
## MATTHEW:
You don’t need to be on exhibit like this.
---
## MATTHEW:
It’s disgusting.
---
## MATTHEW:
We could get married…
---
## AMALIA:
Where would I put the ring?
---
## MATTHEW:
Around your neck.
---
## MATTHEW:
On a golden chain.
---
## MATTHEW:
I’d take care of you. My love.
---
## MATTHEW:
Feed you.
---
## MATTHEW:
Wash your sweet face with cool water.
---
## MATTHEW:
Give you to drink.
---
## AMALIA:
Could you show me?
---
## AMALIA:
Matthew?
---
## AMALIA:
Could you talk them in?
---
## AMALIA:
To see a living marvel, a monstrous atrocity of God?
---
## MATTHEW:
I told you, you don’t need to do that anymore.
---
## MATTHEW:
I can do all kinds of stuff, get a job with good pay.
---
## AMALIA:
And leave me alone, twelve hours a day?
---
## AMALIA:
I need a man who can show me, who depends on me for his feed.
---
## AMALIA:
His livelihood.
---
## AMALIA:
Who will stick close by me every day.
---
## AMALIA:
Yes, and love me.
---
## AMALIA:
Concern himself with my needs and my happiness.
---
## AMALIA:
Take pride in my strength, my ability to work long hours, my skill at captivating an audience,
---
## AMALIA:
charming the extra coins from their pockets in a music of metal rain.
---
## AMALIA:
I am the center of the universe.
---
## AMALIA:
I am the means of production.
---
## AMALIA:
I am the goods.
---
## AMALIA:
You think you can take me away from all this?
---
## AMALIA:
Save me?
---
## AMALIA:
From the shame of exhibition?
---
## AMALIA:
Save me?
---
## AMALIA:
By leaving me alone, day after day, staring at a spot on the wallpaper or god knows what,
---
## AMALIA:
diapered, helpless lying on my back?
---
## MATTHEW:
Judith could come with us, then.
---
## AMALIA:
*Don’t you know anything*?
---
## AMALIA:
She longs to be free of me.
---
## AMALIA:
I can hear it in her blood, pulsing just under her skin.
---
## AMALIA:
I could not leave and steal her with me.
---
## AMALIA:
It’s she who will leave.
---
## AMALIA:
Not I.
---
## AMALIA:
I…will not leave.
---
## AMALIA:
I’ll never leave him.
---
## AMALIA:
You must have known.
---
## AMALIA:
You act as though I am telling you something, but you must have known this.
---
## AMALIA:
Matthew.
---
## AMALIA:
Would you like to brush my hair?
---
## MATTHEW:
Are you sending me away?
---
## AMALIA:
Yes.

She has picked you.

## MR FLIP:
Damn you, don’t leave me. I mean, us.
---
## MR FLIP:
I mean, what will I do?
---
## JUDITH:
You’ll do just fine.
---
## MR FLIP:
YOU CAN’T LEAVE.
---
## MR FLIP:
I know, I know the news from your sister’s a shock…
---
## JUDITH:
I’ve been leaving for a long time, Max.
---
## MR FLIP:
*Traitorous bitch*.
---
## MR FLIP:
Bring me the child!
---
## JUDITH:
Bitch, yes.
---
## JUDITH:
You saw to that.
---
## JUDITH:
If her blood stops, send for me.
---
## JUDITH:
Other than that, you’re ready.
---
## MR FLIP:
No.
---
## MR FLIP:
What if she won’t feed?
---
## MR FLIP:
It’s only been a fruit or two from my hands.
---
## JUDITH:
She has chosen you.
---
## JUDITH:
Now it will be you.
---
## JUDITH:
She’ll feed from no one else’s hand.
---
## MR FLIP:
Where’s your pride, girl?
---
---
## JUDITH:
Goodbye.
---
---
## AMALIA:
Did I keep you too long?
---
## AMALIA:
I couldn’t bear&#8288;—
---
## JUDITH:
I know.
---
## AMALIA:
I can’t. I changed my mind.
---
## AMALIA:
Bring everything back.
---
## AMALIA:
Don’t go. I can’t&#8288;—
---
## JUDITH:
Don’t you trust me?
---
## JUDITH:
Well, then. It’s time.
---
## AMALIA:
Judith&#8288;—
---
## JUDITH:
Yes?
---
## AMALIA:
My hair.
---
## AMALIA:
Teach him to do my hair before you go.
---
## JUDITH:
Didn’t he devise the style himself?
---
## AMALIA:
Yes, but can he do it?
---
## JUDITH:
He used to do mine.
---
## JUDITH:
That’s how I learned.
---
## JUDITH:
I love you more than any creature has the right to ask.
---
## JUDITH:
If anyone hurts you I’ll track them and kill them.
---
## JUDITH:
Rip their neck out with my teeth.
---
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
Pssst.Louisa.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
Tonight.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
We can go tonight.
---
## THE GIRL:
What?
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
I can do it.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
I can breathe.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
We can leave this place.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
I can get work on a farm.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
Or in a factory.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
We can leave tonight.
---
## THE GIRL:
Why?
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
You wanted to leave&#8288;—
---
## THE GIRL:
No!
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
Your ear…it’s bleeding.
---
## THE GIRL:
Damn!
---
## THE GIRL:
Mr. Flip!
---
---
## THE GIRL:
I have decided you can be trusted with the secret of my parentage.
---
## THE GIRL:
My mother knew the dark arts.
---
## THE GIRL:
For we come of a dark people.
---
## THE GIRL:
She was full-blood gypsy.
---
## THE GIRL:
Through her blood was passed to me the ability to see into the future,
---
## THE GIRL:
which all our tribe possess deep within but only a few know how to bring up to the surface.
---
## THE GIRL:
My mother taught me, before she died.
---
## THE GIRL:
How to read the future in the lines of a hand.
---
## THE GIRL:
Also in tea-leaves.
---
## THE GIRL:
Every time my father caught her teaching me the ancient secrets of her tribe,
---
## THE GIRL:
he would beat her severely, and me as well,
---
## THE GIRL:
but she took most of the blows, shielding me with her body.
---
## THE GIRL:
Until one night he shot her, then himself.
---
## THE GIRL:
As I lay shaking in my bed.
---
## MR FLIP:
So that is how you come to us.
---
## THE GIRL:
Yes.
---
## MR FLIP:
And what does my hand say?
---
## THE GIRL:
Good.
---
## THE GIRL:
This is very good.
---
## THE GIRL:
This line here shows success.
---
## THE GIRL:
You see it is broken here…
---
## THE GIRL:
Business is good.
---
## THE GIRL:
And bad.
---
## THE GIRL:
And good again.
---
## THE GIRL:
But you see this line?
---
## THE GIRL:
All the way, curving off the side.
---
## THE GIRL:
Love.
---
## THE GIRL:
Till you draw your last breath.
---
## THE GIRL:
The hand does not lie.
---
## MR FLIP:
Hmm.
---
## MR FLIP:
Well, I’m glad you have deemed us trustworthy with this…secret.
---
## MR FLIP:
And I see no reason to keep your gift hidden from the public.
---
## THE GIRL:
Once we’re away from here&#8288;—
---
## MR FLIP:
Yes, of course, once we’re away from here.
---
## THE GIRL:
I would not wish to&#8288;—
---
## MR FLIP:
Of course&#8288;—
---
## THE GIRL:
Shame my mother’s memory.
---
## MR FLIP:
I understand.
---
## MR FLIP:
We’ll pick up what you need on the next jump.
---
## THE GIRL:
Yes.
---
## MR FLIP:
Well. If you’ll excuse me…
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
Why didn’t you tell me that before?
---
## AMALIA:
Because she just made it up.
---
## THE GIRL:
Well, not all of it.
---
## THE GIRL:
Just the gypsy part.
---
## THE GIRL:
Damn! Don’t tell him&#8288;—
---
## AMALIA:
My dear, he knows.
---
## THE GIRL:
Then what’s he waiting for?
---
## THE GIRL:
Why doesn’t he tear into me?
---
## THE GIRL:
Rip me to shreds?
---
## AMALIA:
Don’t be silly.
---
## AMALIA:
You’re family now.
---
## THE HUMAN SALAMANDER:
I thought you wanted to run away.
---
## THE GIRL:
No…
---
## THE GIRL:
No!
---
## THE GIRL:
I wanted you to be with me.
---
## THE GIRL:
So you can get out of that tank now?
---
## THE GIRL:
Well…
---
## THE GIRL:
Why don’t you show me around?
---
---
## MR FLIP:
That girl’s got guts.
---
## MR FLIP:
Pierced her own ears with a nail and a potato.
---
## MR FLIP:
Looks like she slaughtered a chicken in there.
---
## MR FLIP:
Reminds me of me when I was that age.
---
## MR FLIP:
Wasn’t much older when I found Judith.
---
## MR FLIP:
We always say I invented her, but she just about equal invented me.
---
## MR FLIP:
I never was a talker before her.
---
## MR FLIP:
But she was something people had to see.
---
## MR FLIP:
A wonder of the universe.
---
## AMALIA:
So now it’s just us.
---
## MR FLIP:
Yes.
---
## MR FLIP:
Are you hungry?
---
## MR FLIP:
Can I get you something?
---
## AMALIA:
No.
---
## MR FLIP:
Thirsty?
---
## AMALIA:
No.
---
## AMALIA:
Maybe later.
---
## AMALIA:
You’re making me nervous.
---
## AMALIA:
Hovering around like an invalid’s nurse.
---
## AMALIA:
I’m fine. Go run the business.
---
## MR FLIP:
All right.
---
---
## PINHEAD:
Jesus came to me in my sleep.
---
## PINHEAD:
He said I’m locked up.
---
## PINHEAD:
Am I locked up?
---
## PINHEAD:
Caged. He said.
---
## PINHEAD:
Treated like an animal.
---
## AMALIA:
Daniel, we love the animals.
---
## PINHEAD:
Oh, yes.
---
## PINHEAD:
Jesus said this place was full of sin.
---
## PINHEAD:
A hell.
---
## PINHEAD:
And like hell, it should burn.
---
## AMALIA:
Daniel.
---
## PINHEAD:
A great cleansing fire&#8288;—
---
## AMALIA:
You just had a bad dream.
---
## PINHEAD:
No. He left matches. See&#8288;—
---
## AMALIA:
Daniel. No.
---
## AMALIA:
Put them down.
---
## PINHEAD:
Ah!
---
---
## MR FLIP:
You know, that new kid’s got a great act.
---
## MR FLIP:
Because while people may or may not delight in an aquatic human,
---
## MR FLIP:
a saucy torso, or a boy with a very small head,
---
## MR FLIP:
everybody wants to know THE FUTURE.
---
## MR FLIP:
What’s to become of us?
---
## MR FLIP:
What lies in store?
---
## MR FLIP:
A thousand *thousand* tent shows more
---
## MR FLIP:
or one tremendous blaze of glory *FLASH* against the night-sky all they saw
---
## MR FLIP:
because the jilted lover in our tawdry little story left a box of matches in the Pinhead’s straw?
---
## MR FLIP:
Or are we just run out of town by crowd and clergy
---
## MR FLIP:
because the sight of some monstrosity caused a pregnant woman to miscarry?
---
## MR FLIP:
So.
---
## MR FLIP:
What do you think?
---
## MR FLIP:
What will it be?
---
## MR FLIP:
Am I burned in effigy?
---
## MR FLIP:
Or in cage number three?
---
## MR FLIP:
And does my lady love stand fast beside me?
---
## AMALIA:
Of course, darling.
---
## AMALIA:
I’ve got no legs.
---
## MR FLIP:
How could you not love a woman like that?
---
## MR FLIP:
But returning to the question at hand:
---
## MR FLIP:
on reflection that’s too much demand placed on our Pinhead’s thin shoulders&#8288;—
---
## MR FLIP:
the destruction of the universe.
---
## MR FLIP:
No&#8288;—Ladies and Gentlemen, it’s up to you.
---
## MR FLIP:
Won’t one of you STEP FORWARD and dip the first match to the tinder.
---
## MR FLIP:
No?
---
## MR FLIP:
Sign a petition, brand me a sinner?
---
## MR FLIP:
I’ll let you in on a little secret.
---
## MR FLIP:
We did not end in flames.
---
## MR FLIP:
Economics did us in.
---
## MR FLIP:
I think it was the Calvinists, really, and their bloody speechifying scared the good people away
---
## MR FLIP:
to cultivate the perversions of their souls at home, in private.
---
## MR FLIP:
And all these beautiful creatures you see behind me,
---
## MR FLIP:
hand-plucked from the most exotic corners of the earth are now…
---
## MR FLIP:
…*unemployed*.
---
## MR FLIP:
Not much, is it?
---
## MR FLIP:
Sad, small and tedious.
---
## MR FLIP:
Barely worth the price of admission.
---
## MR FLIP:
We can’t let it end like this.
---
## MR FLIP:
Not after all we’ve been through.
---
## MR FLIP:
Ladies and Gentlemen, that’s not a fitting end for us.
---
## MR FLIP:
And certainly not for you.
---
## MR FLIP:
So come, children.
---
## MR FLIP:
Let’s show them what should have been.
---
## MR FLIP:
“THE END” IN FLAMES.
---
## MR FLIP:
And will you die with me, good lady?
---
## AMALIA:
I never considered anyone else.
