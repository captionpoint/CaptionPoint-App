## TOMMY:
Hello there, I’m Tom.
---
## TUPPENCE:
I am Tuppence.
---
## TOMMY:
We’re on the case of the ringing cell phone.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Please turn them off.
---
Don’t make us come after you and arrest you
---
for disturbing the audience.
---
## TOMMY:
None of those new-fangled photographs
---
or videos either.
---
Please.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Most importantly,
---
remember to keep your masks on.
---
## TOMMY:
These days
---
it’s the good guys who wear masks.
---
## TUPPENCE:
See you in London.
---
Ta-ta.

## TOMMY:
Mike, my friend, 
a pint of bitter for me,
---
if you please.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Pish.
---
Forget that order, Mike,
and bring us a bottle
---
of your best bubbly
and real champagne, if you please.
---
None of that sparkling plonk 
the Italians try and pass off.
---
I wouldn’t give tuppence for that swill.
---
## MIKE:
Tommy.
---
Tuppence.
---
I’m afraid I’ve been given strict instructions
---
not to serve you.
---
## TOMMY:
Mike, my friend,
---
what on earth could you possibly mean?
---
We are two of your best customers.
---
## MIKE:
Well, two of my most frequent customers,
---
I would agree.
---
As to the best, well,
my best customers pay
---
for their drinks.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Dear Mike, is that all?
---
Go ahead, Tommy, 
pay the good pub keeper
---
for our back bill.
---
## TOMMY:
What do we owe you?
---
## MIKE:
All told,
it comes to £1, 10 and 6.
---
## TUPPENCE:
A trifling sum, Mike.
---
## TOMMY:
Glad to settle up,
---
and how much for that bottle of bubbly?
---
## MIKE:
Call it £2 even
and I’ll pop the cork.
---
## TOMMY:
Can you change a fiver?
---
I’m afraid
I didn’t have anything smaller.
---
## MIKE:
Well, I can’t handle a bill that big.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Then keep the change, Mike,
---
and put it on our account.
---
## MIKE:
Listen here you two eggs,
---
last time I saw you, 
you couldn’t afford a half-pint of bitter.
---
Now you’re flashing it around
---
like you’re a member 
of the bloody Royal Family.
---
What gives?
---
## TOMMY:
We’re in the money, my friend.
---
Thanks to Adventurers Limited.
---
## MIKE:
Who were the Adventurers 
when they’re at home?
---
## TUPPENCE:
Why us, of course, 
dearest Mike, Tommy,
---
and I were, as you know, 
finding it a bit tricky
---
to adjust to life back here in London
---
since our own nearest and dearest
---
were not as pleased 
as they might at our presence of Jack Tar.
---
## TOMMY:
That’s an understatement.
---
Mater closed the door in my face
---
and when I hit my uncle up for a job
---
he chucked me out onto the street.
---
Literally.
---
Didn’t even have the good grace
to have the butler do it.
---
I ask you.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Why, might you wonder?
---
Simply because the two 
of us have spent a few years working
---
for the government after
the Great War was over.
---
Can we help it if those jobs happened
---
to put us in some dicky spots?
---
## MIKE:
Together.
---
Without being married?
---
Might that have something to do with it?
---
## TOMMY:
A pure coincidence, 
old bean, I assure you.
---
Tuppence and I have known 
each other since childhood.
---
We just work well together, that’s all.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Now 
that we’ve finally been de-mobbed,
---
thrown out in the dustbin, as it were,
---
we’ve been left to fend for ourselves.
---
Our reputations seemingly 
working against us,
---
to our amazement.
---
## TOMMY:
That’s when it hit us,
---
why not do the same thing 
for private citizens
---
as we did for the old army?
---
Find things that were missing 
like well, people and such.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Turns out 
an old friend of the family
---
was in need of just 
such a service, on the QT,
---
you understand, 
and a cousin of mine recommended us.
---
Thus, was Adventurers Limited born.
---
## TOMMY:
Handn’t you noticed
---
our absence the last two weeks or so?
---
## MIKE:
Of course.
---
Well, I noticed Miss Crowley’s absence.
---
Yours wasn’t so noteworthy, Mr. Beresford.
---
I just assumed it had to do
---
with your bill being in arrears and all.
---
What was it you two was doing?
---
## TOMMY:
A tale for another time, Mike.
---
## TUPPENCE:
All very hush-hush, I fear.
---
## MIKE:
How are you going
to dig up more work?
---
You got a bundle of cousins
somewhere or something?
---
## TOMMY:
Advertising, Mike.
---
We’re a modern family.
---
Take a gander.
---
## MIKE:
Oh, you’re going
---
to investigate why Parliament’s run by loonies.
---
## TOMMY:
Oh, not the front page, my friend.
---
The back page.
---
There you go.
---
## MIKE:
Ah, “Adventurers Limited.
---
Two adventurers for hire.
---
Willing to do anything, go anywhere.
---
Pay must be good.
---
No unreasonable offer refused.
---
Inquire 23 Brewer’s Chase, Soho.” Hey.
---
That’s this place.
---
## TOMMY:
We didn’t have a secretary yet, Mike.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Let alone an office
for her to sit in.
---
## TOMMY:
The more business 
we give the more likely
---
we’re able to continue paying our tab.
---
## MIKE:
Oh, I always 
wondered who put these kinds
---
of things in the personals.
---
You read the rummest things in here.
---
Like this one.
---
“Petunia, I’ve waited 
in the callbox every night this month.
---
Please come back.
---
Best Boy.” How about this one,
---
“Seeking information
on the location
---
of a Miss Rosey Bottoms 
of Texas, USA.
---
Anyone with information,
telephone Regent 3519.” Rosey Bottoms.
---
I ask you, what kind 
of bloke would name a child that?
---
## TUPPENCE:
Oh, Tommy
and I heard a number of such names
---
when we were in the States after the war.
---
What was the name
of that one Texas lady, Tommy?
---
The First Lady of Texas they called her?
---
## TOMMY:
Ima Hogg.
---
## MIKE:
Oh, never.
---
Pull the other one, guv’nor.
---
## TUPPENCE:
No, truly, Mike,
a proud Texas family,
---
the Hoggs, and always willing to brag.
---
## TOMMY:
Nothing embarrasses 
an American, Mike.
---
Remember that.
---
Whoof, I got to run, Tuppence.
---
If I don’t get my landlady paid today, 
I’ll be out on my ear.
---
See you tomorrow at noon, 
Piccadilly Tube Station as usual.
---
## MIKE:
Clear, Miss Crowley.
---
When is that bloke going to break down
---
and make an honest woman of you?
---
## TUPPENCE:
Heaven forfend, Mike,
---
why would we want to ruin 
a good friendship,
---
not to mention a great
business partnership?
---
No.
---
We’re both fine with things
as they are, Mike.
---
## MIKE:
So you’re not in love with Tommy?
---
## TUPPENCE:
Do I look like the type of girl
---
to fall in love at the drop of a hat, Mike?
---
## MIKE:
No.
---
You look like the one doing
the hat dropping
---
and I think you’ve already dropped
yours in front of Mr. Beresford.
---
---
## WHITTINGTON:
I’m a bit embarrassed, my friend,
---
but could you tell me
how I might be able
---
to get in touch
with a firm called Adventurers Limited?
---
They gave me this address 
but well, you’re a pub.
---
## MIKE:
The problem with that is?
---
## WHITTINGTON:
Nothing at all, my good man.
---
It’s just I was rather
expecting an office.
---
## MIKE:
Well, this is as close 
as you get to that at least for now.
---
Their real office is being 
what you call “renovated”.
---
So I’m taking messages for them.
---
## WHITTINGTON:
I’m Mr. Richard Whittington.
---
## MIKE:
Dick Whittington.
---
Need them find the cat sent out 
to catch the rats, do you?
---
## WHITTINGTON:
I beg your pardon?
---
## MIKE:
Never mind.
---
Too many Christmas pantomimes growing up.
---
## WHITTINGTON:
I was hoping
to hook with them this afternoon.
---
## MIKE:
It already is this afternoon.
---
## WHITTINGTON:
Precisely.
---
Please see that they get this 
as soon as possible.
---
## TUPPENCE:
I just realized I’d forgotten
---
the rest of the bubbly.
---
Not going to let that go to waste.
---
## MIKE:
Perfect timing you’ve got as usual.
---
Some bloke stopped by,
---
says he needs to see you 
and needs to see you now.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Estonia Glass Works?
---
The adventure is starting to simmer.
---
template: music
---
## WHITTINGTON:
Oh.
---
[laughs] You must be from Adventurers Limited.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Well, if someone must be, 
it might as well be I.
---
## WHITTINGTON:
Well, do have a seat.
---
I have a job for you.
---
£10 a day, £100 on account, 
and all expenses paid.
---
## TUPPENCE:
The nature of the work?
---
## WHITTINGTON:
A pleasant couple
of weeks in Paris.
---
## TUPPENCE:
My father, the vicar, 
would be scandalized.
---
## WHITTINGTON:
What?
---
No, no.
---
What? What?
---
No, no.
---
My word.
---
No.
---
I just need you to go 
to a small pensionnats
---
de jeunes filles run by a Madame Colombier
---
on the Avenue de Neuilly.
---
It’s a perfectly respectable establishment.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Once I was there?
---
## WHITTINGTON:
I need someone
with sufficient intelligence
---
and presence of mind
to pretend to be someone else.
---
Someone who has had amnesia 
for the past years
---
and is just now getting
their memory back
---
and remembering certain details.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Those details would be?
---
## WHITTINGTON:
Provided once you arrive.
---
## TUPPENCE:
What would
my name be once I was there?
---
## WHITTINGTON:
That doesn’t matter to me.
---
You can choose your own nom secret.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Rosey Bottoms.
---
## WHITTINGTON:
That’s your little game, is it?
---
Been playing with me
---
the whole time like a cat and mouse.
---
Knew what I was up to all along, did you?
---
Who’s been blabbing to you?
---
Rita.
---
Is that it?
---
## TUPPENCE:
Yes.
---
It was Rita.
---
## WHITTINGTON:
Argh.
---
How much do you know?
---
## TUPPENCE:
I don’t know much.
---
## WHITTINGTON:
Quit fooling.
---
If you know that name,
---
you must know more than
you’re willing to admit.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Far be it from me
---
to contradict a man 
of your obvious intelligence.
---
## WHITTINGTON:
What is it?
---
Yes, I see.
---
I’ve just gotten a telephone message.
---
I’m afraid we’ll have 
to continue this tomorrow.
---
Can you return then?
---
## TUPPENCE:
Absolutely,
---
and I’ll bring my partner with me, of course.
---
## WHITTINGTON:
What?
---
Whatever you think best.
---
## TUPPENCE:
What time?
---
## WHITTINGTON:
I beg your pardon?
---
## TUPPENCE:
What time should we arrive?
---
## WHITTINGTON:
Oh, yes.
---
Time.
---
Arrive.
---
Let’s say two o’clock.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Might I expect the retainer
---
before I leave?
---
## WHITTINGTON:
I see.
---
Blackmail.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Oh, no.
---
Shall we just say the payment
---
for services in advance?
---
As you promised.
---
You see, I am so very fond of money.
---
## WHITTINGTON:
Here’s the £100 
we already discussed.
---
That should hold you for now.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Delightful.
---
Until tomorrow, then.

Hello?
---
Tuppence, old girl-- What’s that?
---
Slow down.
---
You’ve been trying to get ahold
---
of me since yesterday?
---
Where have I been?
---
Eating and sleeping, 
and paying off a few debts.
---
What’s the matter?
---
The adventure is simmering?
---
What adventure?
---
What do you mean?
---
Well, if you’re this excited,
---
then yes, of course, I’ll meet you.
---
Be there right off.

## JANITOR:
You looking 
for Esthonia Glass Works?
---
## TUPPENCE:
Yes.
---
## JANITOR:
Shut up,
---
tighter than my aunt’s cupboard on Christmas.
---
Cleared out yesterday, they did.
---
## TUPPENCE:
I don’t suppose
they’ve left a forwarding address?
---
## JANITOR:
Not on your life.
---
The guv’nor told me this morning
---
that he was glad 
he got his rent in advance,
---
that’s for sure.
---
## TOMMY:
Oh, I say, 
you can’t do that.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Why ever not?
---
## TOMMY:
It was supposed to be my turn.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Sorry, Tommy.
---
You’ve just got to be quicker off
the mark, my friend.
---
---
## TOMMY:
Well, that’s a rum go.
---
They don’t seem to have 
left anything behind
---
in the way of clues.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Well, they did leave one clue.
---
## TOMMY:
Where on earth 
did you get that?
---
## TUPPENCE:
In Mr. Whittington’s back.
---
With this stuck to him by the knife.
---
Oh, Tuppence
to a ha’penny you’ll remember
---
where we’ve seen this before.
---
## TOMMY:
Yes, when we were in Ukrania
---
during the 1920 takeover by the Bolsheviks.
---
The Ukrainians called it “znak strakhu”, 
the sign of fear.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Now--
---
## TOMMY:
Yes.
---
Now, here in England.
---
## TUPPENCE:
We’ve got to get 
to the bottom of this, Tommy.
---
This must be because I just happened
---
to mention the name Rosey Bottoms.
---
Whittington became terrified 
when I said it.
---
## TOMMY:
That ad must
have been part of all of this.
---
## TUPPENCE:
We’ve got to find out who else
---
is searching for Rosey Bottoms.
---
## TOMMY:
Why?
---
## TUPPENCE:
But how?
---
## TOMMY:
Simple, old girl.
---
We’ll place another advert.
---
template: music
---
## TUPPENCE:
Well, that was quick.
---
## TOMMY:
I knew it would work, Tuppence.
---
I mean, what person looking
---
for a mystery doesn’t read The Daily Mail?
---
## TUPPENCE:
Now we’ve 
got two responses to follow up on.
---
“Dear Adventurers,
---
referring to your advertisement
in this morning’s paper,
---
you may be able to be 
of assistance to me.
---
Perhaps you might be so good
as to call on me at my home,
---
27 Carshalton Gardens, at teatime.
---
Yours truly. A. Carter.”
---
That’s Gloucester Roadway.
---
Should be worth £50 easy.
---
## TOMMY:
“Adventurers, regarding your advert,
---
I was hoping I might be able 
to have a yak session with you.
---
Will meet you at your offices there 
on Brewer’s Chase at 5 PM.
---
I hear I might be able to wet
my whistle while we gab.
---
Yours truly, Sam.” 
Ah, an American.
---
Not quite sure about this one.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Yes, but look 
at the mark on that notepaper.
---
He’s staying at the Ritz.
---
## TOMMY:
Oh, the Ritz?
---
That beats Gloucester Road.
---
Should be worth £100.
---
Perhaps we should follow up
this one instead.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Why not split up 
and do both.
---
## TOMMY:
That could be dangerous.
---
## TUPPENCE:
We’ll flip to decide.
---
## TOMMY:
Your lucky Tuppence, I assume?
---
## TUPPENCE:
Of course.
---
Heads, that means we split up.
---
## TOMMY:
You do realize that you’re supposed to call it

---

before you do the toss, don’t you?
---
## TUPPENCE:
But then I might lose.
---
You take Mr. Carter 
and I’ll meet the American.
---
Ta-ta.
---
template: music
---
## CARTER:
Well, hello, Mr. Beresford.
---
I might have known this 
was one of your schemes.
---
I had heard tales 
of what had become of you
---
after you were dismissed 
from the King’s service.
---
## TOMMY:
Is it, Carter?
---
## CARTER:
Ah, I see you recognize me.
---
## TOMMY:
Yes.
---
I saw you in France when I--
---
that is when we were, 
well, with the department.
---
## CARTER:
Yes.
---
I might have guessed.
---
I was told of you often 
by your superior officers.
---
## TOMMY:
Nothing but words
of praise, I assume?
---
## CARTER:
Actually, they told me,
---
you were the kind of soldier,
---
they would either win the Victoria’s cross
---
or get himself hanged, or both.
---
## TOMMY:
Ah, well.
---
I can’t actually suggest 
they were wrong,
---
but I don’t seem to recall 
your name being Carter at that time.
---
## CARTER:
For our purposes,
---
let’s just agree upon
that name for now, shall we?
---
## TOMMY:
Absolutely, sir.
---
## CARTER:
Might I be correct in assuming
---
that Miss Crowley
is the other half of this enterprise?
---
## TOMMY:
You might, indeed, sir.
---
## CARTER:
Delightful.
---
Now tell me what you know
---
about the whereabouts of Miss Rosey Bottoms.
---
## TOMMY:
Ah, well, that’s easy, sir.
---
We don’t.
---
## CARTER:
Don’t what?
---
## TOMMY:
Know.
---
## CARTER:
You don’t where she is now 
or where she was before?
---
## TOMMY:
Precisely.
---
## CARTER:
Precisely what?
---
## TOMMY:
Precisely, sir.
---
I mean, we don’t know, well, anything.
---
Except for her name,
---
and the fact that someone was willing
---
to pay Tuppence £100 to get her out
---
of the way once she mentioned the name.
---
A name which neither 
of us had ever heard
---
of before this week when
we saw it in another advert.
---
## CARTER:
Who, precisely, paid you this sum?
---
## TOMMY:
Well, that’s where 
we’re a bit lost, sir.
---
It was a Mr. Whittington
---
of a company called Esthonia Glass Works.
---
Only before we could get 
to the bottom of it,
---
Esthonia folded up
its tent and stole away
---
into the night, leaving Mr. Whittington 
behind with a souvenir stuck
---
about 4 inches into his back.
---
## CARTER:
Rather inconvenient.
---
What did you do with the body?
---
## TOMMY:
Nothing so far.
---
## CARTER:
Leave it to me.
---
Who placed the first advert?
---
## TOMMY:
Well, when I came here and saw you,
---
I had supposed it was the Agency.
---
## CARTER:
You supposed wrong,
young master Thomas.
---
We’re just as interested
in this question as you are.
---
## TOMMY:
Can you tell me why?
---
## CARTER:
First, tell me
if you found anything else.
---
## TOMMY:
This was attached
to the souvenir in Whittington’s body.
---
## CARTER:
“Znak strakhu.” Oh my.
---
It’s here in Britain.
---
How troubling.
---
I’m guessing they’re trying to make use
---
of the threat of a general strike
---
that the government 
is dealing with right now.
---
## TOMMY:
Can you tell me anything 
about Rosie Bottoms
---
and why everyone is looking for her?
---
## CARTER:
Ah, I suppose you’re entitled to know that.
---
It involves a Secret treaty 
between Great Britain
---
and the United States.
---
The final version was signed 
by the US Secretary State in 1915.
---
Our copy was being 
dispatched back to England
---
by a special messenger Danvers, alas.
---
Danvers sailed on the Lusitania.
---
## TOMMY:
Oh my, it was on that trip?
---
## CARTER:
Precisely.
---
Danvers kept the treaty
---
in an oilskin package
he wore next to his skin.
---
After the Lusitania 
was torpedoed and sunk,
---
Danvers body was recovered 
with numerous bullet holes in it,
---
but the oilskin packet was missing.
---
Our investigation turned up 
a survivor
---
who said she’d seen Danvers talking
---
to an American girl
just before the ship went down.
---
Since our enemies
never released the papers,
---
it’s obvious they didn’t get them from Danvers.
---
It now seems likely that he would
have entrusted them to a woman,
---
knowing that the ship
was going down and, well-
---
## TOMMY:
Woman and children first.
---
## CARTER:
Precisely.
---
Now, although we know the woman 
was amongst those rescued,
---
once she reached our shores 
she simply disappeared.
---
Until earlier this year 
when one of our spies caught word
---
that the Bolsheviks 
were searching for the copy
---
and claimed to have a lead 
on the existence of the missing woman.
---
## TOMMY:
The woman’s name 
was Rosey Bottoms.
---
## CARTER:
Indeed.
---
One must love our cousins across
the pond and their eccentricities.
---
## TOMMY:
Why does it matter now?
---
## CARTER:
Because that treaty
was a gigantic blunder.
---
If it were to make surface, 
if it were to become public,
---
it would be particularly embarrassing
for the Americans
---
to have their secrets revealed.
---
## TOMMY:
What’s that got to do with us?
---
## CARTER:
Our own government 
was a party to this.
---
That revelation 
could very well cost us the next election
---
and give the Communists 
a chance to get a foothold
---
in the Parliament.
---
Bolshevist gold
is pouring into this country,
---
under the control of some Secret Council.
---
This council is using it
to support the Labour Party
---
and their call for a General Strike.
---
I don’t need to tell you how difficult
---
a general strike would be for Britain.
---
Tell me, are you familiar 
with Lord Peel-Edgerton?
---
## TOMMY:
Absolutely, one of the finest leaders
---
in our government.
---
## CARTER:
Indeed.
---
If it weren’t for Lord Peel-Edgerton
dealing with the Trades Unions,
---
the lid might have already blown.
---
Meanwhile, as long as the Bolsheviks 
keep funding all the trouble,
---
we’re in danger.
---
The man behind this 
is the one we need to find.
---
All we know is that 
his fellow conspirators call him
---
by his code name, Yellow.
---
If we can find him, 
we can destroy his network
---
and leave British politics 
in the hands of the British.
---
I mean, the idea
of using foreign influence
---
to help determine 
a British election is something
---
that should chill everyone,
regardless of their political leanings.
---
## TOMMY:
Indeed.
---
What politician would want
to win with the help of the Russians?
---
Isn’t that part 
of what we just fought an entire war about,
---
keeping Britain safe from foreign nations?
---
## CARTER:
The only thing we now know for sure
---
is that they now know we’re looking
---
and no one seems to know 
where Miss Rosey Bottoms is.
---
So we’ll pay the Adventurers
---
to keep following
whatever trail you can find,
---
just so long as you report 
your findings directly back to me.
---
## TOMMY:
Ah, yes.
---
Pay.
---
Might I ask?
---
## CARTER:
£300.
---
## TOMMY:
Ah, yes.
---
That seems quite reasonable.
---
## CARTER:
And an equal amount 
for Miss Crowley, of course.
---
## TOMMY:
Of course.
---
## CARTER:
And expenses.
---
I mean we can’t expect you 
to cover those.
---
Here we are.
---
An advancement.
---
Let me know when you need more.
---
Now get to it.
---

## TUPPENCE:
Well, Mike, it’s after 6:00.
---
Looks like I’ve been stood up.
---
I just hope Tommy 
had more luck than I did.
---
I’d better go by his flat
and see what he found out.
---
---
## SAM:
I’m looking
for the offices of Adventurers Limited.
---
Is this it?
---
## MIKE:
In a manner of speaking, 
you must be the American.
---
## SAM:
What gave me away, my accent?
---
## MIKE:
No, your tie and your tardiness.
---
Both are a tad bit distasteful.
---
You just missed Miss Crowley,
---
the better half of the Adventurers.
---
## SAM:
You mean that doll that just left?
---
Oh.
---
[screaming] Hey, you, you with the legs!
---
Hold your horses,
---
or whatever it is you folks drive over here.
---
I’m here to meet you.
---
## MIKE:
Ah, Americans.
---
Always subtle.
---
## SAM:
Well, hello there.
---
You must be the woman 
from Adventurers Limited, I’m guessing.
---
Two-Pence, right?
---
## TUPPENCE:
Well, yes and no.
---
I am, indeed, her, 
but my name is Tuppence.
---
## SAM:
Oh, beg my pardon.
---
I’m still trying to get 
a handle on the lingo here.
---
I still haven’t gotten used
---
to the “u’s” you folks like
to just throw into words.
---
Would you care to join me?
---
Two Martinis, my good man, 
and something for the lady.
---
What will you have?
---
## TUPPENCE:
When with a Roman-
---
## SAM:
Make that three Martinis.
---
## MIKE:
I’ve heard of them, I’ve never made one.
---
## SAM:
Gin and Vermouth.
---
All you do is just shake it up, pour it on.
---
There you go.
---
Well then.
---
What have you done with my cousin?
---
## TUPPENCE:
I’m sorry, your cousin?
---
## SAM:
Rosey.
---
My cousin Rosey.
---
If you’ve hurt her, trust me, 
I’ll make sure you pay.
---
If there’s a ransom, I’ll make sure I pay.
---
Just tell me.
---
## TUPPENCE:
We haven’t got her.
---
If we did, we wouldn’t be
holding her for ransom.
---
What do you mean, your cousin?
---
## SAM:
Okay, let me put you wise
to what I’m talking about,
---
and then you can do the same.
---
My name is Sam Charles.
---
Rosey is my cousin.
---
## TUPPENCE:
When did 
you last see her, Mr. Charles?
---
## SAM:
Never saw her before in my life.
---
## TUPPENCE:
I-
--

## SAM:
I beg my pardon.
---
I’m sorry.
---
Yes, I know.
---
Here’s the scoop.
---
My father and her mother 
were brother and sister.
---
My aunt decided 
to get married to Amos Bottoms
---
and had his baby,
a little girl named Rosey.
---
Only it didn’t exactly happen 
in that order,
---
if you catch my drift.
---
My grandfather hated Amos
for soiling his daughter
---
and he disowned the entire family.
---
So they all ran away to California
---
and eventually my father
lost touch with her.
---
Last year, I decided to find 
my long-lost cousin, Rosey.
---
Now, when I started the search,
---
I went through all of my dad’s old papers
---
and it turns out 
he had been hiding a letter he’d gotten
---
from his sister years ago.
---
She said she didn’t want anything 
to do with his money,
---
so she didn’t let him know where she was,
---
but she did include a photo 
of her daughter, Rosey,
---
to let him know that she was okay.
---
I used that information
to try and track them down.
---
Turns out that my aunt 
and uncle had died,
---
and Rosey had sailed
on the Lusitania in 1915.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Oh my, dreadful timing.
---
## SAM:
You said it.
---
Then it was like she just disappeared.
---
One look at that photo and I knew,
---
I fell in love with my cousin.
---
I knew I had to track her down.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Oh, you poor man.
---
That is so sad.
---
## SAM:
I know.
---
It’s a tough burden to bear,
---
being in love with someone
that you’ve never met.
---
## TUPPENCE:
No, I mean that story.
---
It’s so sad that you really expect anyone 
to believe that mess.
---
I have never in my life heard 
a worse cover story.
---
I mean, tuppence more
and up goes the donkey.
---
## SAM:
[laughs] Oh, I see.
---
I told The Old Man it was a bad idea,
---
but he insisted I keep with it.
---
## MIKE:
Here you go.
---
## SAM:
[coughs]
---
## MIKE:
Is it good?
---
## SAM:
No, but it’s alcohol.
---
Next time, try dry Vermouth.
---
Here, let me save you from this.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Martinis have yet to make it
---
to this neighborhood.
---
Don’t even dream of asking for ice.
---
Now, who’s The Old Man you spoke of?
---
## SAM:
My boss
at The Continental Detective Agency.
---
Now, we got hired
---
to find out what happened
to Rosey Bottoms.
---
The Old Man 
won’t tell us who hired us,
---
which means it’s the government.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Wouldn’t they have their own agents?
---
## SAM:
No, but any time
they can’t risk the chance
---
of getting caught with their own hand in the cookie jar,
---
they farm the workout.
---
The Old Man didn’t tell me that,
---
but I’ve been doing this long enough
---
to put two and two together.
---
## TUPPENCE:
If the United States
---
is searching for this woman, too,
---
then there must be something they’ve found.
---
## SAM:
There is something
that the Old Man did tell us.
---
If there appears 
to be someone involved named Rita.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Rita?
---
That’s the name Whittington told me
before he was killed.
---
## SAM:
Killed?
---
## TUPPENCE:
Stabbed in the glassworks.
---
## SAM:
Is that anywhere near the heart?
---
## TUPPENCE:
So how does Rita
fit into all of this?
---
I’d give tuppence-and-ha’penny 
if Tommy were here right now.
---
## TOMMY:
Speak of the devil 
and he doth appear.
---
And do I have some news 
for you, Old Girl.
---
Hello, who’s this?
---
## TUPPENCE:
This is Sam.
---
He works for the government.
---
## TOMMY:
Well with that tie it can’t be ours.
---
You must be the American.
---
A G-man?
---
## SAM:
Sort of.
---
Indirectly.
---
So, is this your husband
or your boyfriend?
---
## TUPPENCE:
Neither.
---
Well, he’s just Tommy.
---
## SAM:
Well, that solved nothing.
---
[laughing] Nice to meet you, 
Just Tommy.
---
Tuppence here told me
---
about what happened to your first suspect.
---
Who do you suppose stabbed him?
---
## TUPPENCE:
Someone with a knife.
---
## SAM:
[laughs]
---
## TOMMY:
When you two are done
---
with your Punch and Judy show, 
give me a holler.
---
I’ll be over here trying to figure out
---
who would benefit from the Bolsheviks.
---
## SAM:
Bolsheviks?
---
What do they got to do this?
---
## TOMMY:
The Bolsheviks have some sort
---
of Secret Council that’s helping
---
to push the trade unions here in Britain,
---
to go out on a general strike.
---
The last time that happened, in ’26,
---
it was a horrific blow to the nation,
---
even though it only lasted for 9 days.
---
## SAM:
How so?
---
## TUPPENCE:
Over a million 
and a half workers walked out,
---
including the entire mining industry
and all of the railway workers.
---
The entire nation pretty much
ground to a halt.
---
Then, the government authorized
---
a so-called “militia of special constables.” 
You can imagine what happened.
---
## SAM:
I sure can.
---
I saw the blood 
and guts after a group
---
of Pinkertons’ famous strike breakers broke
---
through with strikers in Logan County.
---
Almost 100 people died.
---
That was in ’21.
---
Next year, strikers got theirs back
---
when they killed 22 strikebreakers
in Herrin, Illinois.
---
These things cannot be pretty 
on either side.
---
## TOMMY:
Precisely.
---
After the last general strike,
---
the workers not only didn’t get 
what they had been striking for,
---
most of them found themselves worse off.
---
But that’s the thing.
---
The worse off people are,
the less they have to lose by striking.
---
## TUPPENCE:
There’ve been a number
---
of local strikes since then,
---
which have actually made
some progress on workers’ rights,
---
but even the labor leaders
themselves agree
---
that another general strike would be 
a massive mistake.
---
## SAM:
So, who’s pushing for it?
---
## TOMMY:
No one quite knows,
---
but it’s getting a groundswell 
of support from the workers.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Thank God, 
for men like Lord Peel-Edgerton
---
who are trying to keep 
both sides talking.
---
But if any one of the major papers 
comes out in favor of the strike,
---
I’m not even sure he can stop it.
---
## SAM:
What’s this all got to do 
with Rosey Bottoms?
---
## TOMMY:
I’m not sure.
---
We just know it has something to do 
with some secret treaty.
---
And Rosey Bottoms may have 
been the last one to see it.
---
It seems that she was given the copy
---
by our agent, a fellow named Danvers.
---
But they were last seen 
by a woman named…
---
## TUPPENCE:
Rita.

## SAM:
Rita.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Rita’s the key.
---
Rita must be the one
who saw Danvers talking with Rosey.
---
We got to get a hold of the list
---
of the Lusitania survivors here
in England?
---
If we could find Rita, 
we’ve got a thread to pull.
---
Tommy, do we know anyone 
who can get us a list of the survivors?
---
## TOMMY:
Do we ever.
---
I’ll give him a ring 
and ask him to get it for us.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Him, who?
---
## TOMMY:
You tell me about Sam here,
---
and I’ll tell you about Mr. Carter.
---
Just let me make my phone call first.
---
Something tells me time is of the essence.
---
## TUPPENCE:
We’ve just got to figure out
---
how much all of this is going to cost.
---
That money we got 
from Whittington won’t last forever.
---
## SAM and TOMMY:
I’m on a full expense account 
with the government.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Wait.
---
We’ve got two governments 
covering the same expenses?
---
Gentlemen, I think we might be able
---
to come out of this a bit ahead.
---
template: music
---
## SAM:
Okay.
---
All right.
---
Explain this whole wheeze to me again.
---
## TOMMY:
Well, it turns out 
that the passenger manifest
---
doesn’t list the first names
of any of the women,
---
they’re all listed as “Mrs. Edgar Keith” or the like.
---
## SAM:
No women’s names listed?
---
## TUPPENCE:
Women’s names 
don’t count for much here in Britain.
---
Even now that we’ve got the vote.
---
## TOMMY:
We’re going to start
---
with all of the female survivors living here
---
in London and hope we get lucky.
---
If not, there may be a tour of England,
---
Ireland, and Scotland in our future.
---
## TUPPENCE:
How do we find out their names
---
without giving ourselves away.
---
## SAM:
Too bad you guys
don’t have a Census Bureau here.
---
I use that dodge all the time back 
in San Francisco.
---
## TUPPENCE and TOMMY:
The Borough Council.
---
## SAM:
I beg your pardon.
---
## TOMMY:
The most useless, officious,
---
and meddling bit of governmental
bureaucracy you’ve ever seen,
---
and perfect for our needs.
---
You wait here.

we’re from the Hampstead Borough Council.
---
We’re updating the voting rolls,

Act of 1928.

## WOMAN:
Oh.

Does Mrs. Edgar Keith live here?

## WOMAN:
Yes.

## TOMMY:
Her Christian name, please?

Mrs. Mathilda

Any daughters living here?

No.

Just sons.

Lots of sons.

Lots and lots of sons.

This is the best wheeze
I’ve ever seen.

Is that a gat 
I feel underneath your jacket.

Oh.

I never leave home without it.

Who’s next?

Are you here about the gas?

No, we’re updating the voting rolls.

Does Mrs. Caltrops Portziebee reside here?

## MAN:
Yes.

But what my gas problem?

## TOMMY:
Her first name?

## MAN:
Portia.

But my gas problem.

## TUPPENCE:
Are there any other women

over the age of 21 living here?

## MAN:
Just my wife.
---
Essie.

She’s the one
who keeps complaining

that there must be a gas leak.

Says it’s only in our bedroom.

Thank you, Poppy.

And are you the same
Mrs. Farthingale Fripwich
---
who almost went down on the Lusitania?
---
## FRIPWICH:
Ducky,
---
you have no idea 
how many times I’ve heard that line.
---
Those were all just 
naughty rumors.

## MAN:
She sure does, 
more’s the pity for me.

## TOMMY:
Her first name, please.

## MAN:
Her real first name,

or what I call the little trollop?
---
## TUPPENCE:
Christian name, if you please.
---
## MAN:
Ain’t nothing Christian about her,
---
but the name her mum give her was Pansy.
---
Cork it, you auld cow.

## TOMMY:
Are there any other women

Are you joking?

## TUPPENCE:
Just two more.
---
One in South Audley Mansions, Mayfair.
---
The other back in Soho.
---
## TOMMY:
Let’s start with the Mayfair one.
---
If we strike out here,

at least the Soho one will be back close

to the Weasel and Toad.

Good morning,

we’re with the borough council

We’re looking for a first name
for a Mrs. Vandemeyer.
---
Can you help us with that?

## MARIE:
Bien sûr.

Her name is Marguerite.

Margaret?

Non, Marguerite.

Marguerite.

## MARIE:
Oh, but these English.
---
They have no taste.
---
They call her “Rita”.

## TUPPENCE:
Thank you, that’s all we need.
---
## TOMMY:
Are they any other women
over the age of 21 inside?
---
## TUPPENCE:
Rita, I can’t let them see me.
---
Don’t argue, Sam, just kiss me.
---
## SAM:
I think we ought to do that again.
---
I mean, you never know 
when they might come back.
---
## TOMMY:
The reason you didn’t ask me?
---
## TUPPENCE:
Sam was closer, that’s all.
---
That’s all the proof we need.
---
That was the woman I saw
in Mr. Whittington’s office.
---
She’s connected to the Secret Council.
---
I had my suspicions about her.
---
She’s the one who came in 
and gave Mr. Whittington
---
that phone message
---
that made him cut everything short with me.
---
## SAM:
What’s so suspicious about that?
---
## TUPPENCE:
I never heard the phone ring.
---
## SAM:
Oh, okay.
---
What’s the plan?
---
## TUPPENCE:
We hide
in the alley and watch the door.
---
When the two of them come out, 
you two follow them.
---
## TOMMY:
Both of us?
---
## TUPPENCE:
Yes.
---
That way if they split up,
---
each of you can follow one of them
and see where they lead you.
---
I’ll stay here and try to find a way
---
to get more information
on our little Miss Rita.

Come here, Albert, my young friend,

I want a word with you.

Know what this means?

American police force.
---
## ALBERT:
Lord.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Know who I’m after?
---
Number 20.
---
Calls herself, Vandermeyer.
---
Vandermeyer, Ha.
---
## ALBERT:
A crook?
---
## TUPPENCE:
A crook?
---
I should say so.
---
“Ready Rita”, they call her in the States.
---
## ALBERT:
Ready Rita?
---
Ain’t it just like the pictures?
---
Marie Louise always said
as how she was a bad lot.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Marie Louise?
---
## ALBERT:
The maid.
---
She’s leaving day after tomorrow.
---
Many’s the time she said to me,
---
“Oh, Albert, the madame, 
she treats me so badly.
---
I think it would be no surprise
if the police came to arrest her.”
---
## TUPPENCE:
I see.
---
Have you seen her wearing the emeralds?
---
## ALBERT:
Those the green ones?
---
## TUPPENCE:
Yes.
---
## ALBERT:
No, I ain’t seen none of them.
---
## TUPPENCE:
She stole them 
from an American millionaire
---
by the name of Samuel B. Charles.
---
## ALBERT:
Oh, I think I’ve heard of him.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Sparklers belonged to him.
---
Finest collection of emeralds in the world.
---
Worth over a million dollars.
---
## ALBERT:
Lord love a duck.
---
Oh, this sounds more 
like the pictures all the time.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Life imitates Art, 
my young friend.
---
## ALBERT:
If you say so,
though blow me if I know who Art is.
---
## TUPPENCE:
With your help,
we won’t let her get away with it.
---
Is there any chance of Marie Louise 
leaving early?
---
## ALBERT:
Well, I don’t know 
but I can keep an eye out.
---
## TUPPENCE:
You do that, 
and if you see that Marie Louise has left,
---
has her bags with her and everything,
---
run over to this address
---
and leave a message with for me at the pub.
---
## ALBERT:
Tell the publican she’s gone?
---
## TUPPENCE:
No, Albert.
---
He’s not one of us.
---
We’ll have to use code.
---
Tell him “A tuppence 
is as good as a pound.”
---
He’ll know to get the message to me.
---
## ALBERT:
“A tuppence 
is as good as a pound.” Got it!

Here’s tuppence

my young partner.

## HENCHMAN:
Oh, always good 
to see the Sinn Fein represented.
---
Welcome, Comrade.

Go raibh maith agat, is aingeal thú.

Yellow.

Oh, so the French 
were able to make it then.
---
Welcome, Comrade.

## FRENCHMAN:
Merci.
---
Je pense que ta mère s’est accouplée 
avec un hamster.

Is everyone here?
---
## HENCHMAN:
I think so.
---
I was told the German couldn’t make it.
---
## FRENCHMAN:
Pas de pertes.
---
## TOMMY:
Two, three, and five.
---
I’m one or four.

One or four.

Make a choice, no fear.

No fear.

Oh right vier, four, the German.

I thought you weren’t coming.
---
## TOMMY:
Danke.
---
Du bist ein Schweinhund.
---
## HENCHMAN:
Yes, just come on in.
---
template: music
---
## VLADIMIR:
I am sorry 
to tell you that Yellow
---
could not be here 
for this meeting of the Secret Council,
---
which is why I will be providing you 
with the update.
---
There is much good news to report.
---
The Russian government
---
has sent all of the funds 
we have been asking for.
---
We have already made the loan
---
to the British newspaper that needed it,
---
and they will begin publishing
editorials favorable
---
to our cause this very week.
---
## IRISHMAN:
What if others find out
---
where the loan came from?
---
## VLADIMIR:
The Russian government
---
has already prepared an official denial.
---
We won’t need people 
to actually believe them,
---
it’s enough for them 
to simply sow doubt.
---
Meanwhile, we have already placed
---
our people in positions of power
---
within all of the major unions.
---
The general strike 
will begin in 10 days.
---
This will cripple the entire nation,
---
destroying the economy
---
and plummeting Great Britain
into a depression.
---
This will give the Communists
just what they need
---
to win the next election,
---
and then, Great Britain will be ours.
---
## FRENCHMAN:
But isn’t the government
negotiating even now
---
with the union leaders
to prevent this strike?
---
## VLADIMIR:
[sighing] This guy.
---
As long as our people 
are on the union leadership councils,
---
the government hasn’t 
a chance of stopping this.
---
I’m sorry I did not bring the finger puppets
---
to help you understand.
---
To make it even better,
---
Yellow is even now getting closer
---
and closer to obtaining the one document,
---
which will prove how treasonous 
the British government is.
---
## HENCHMAN:
Oy, Kraut face!
---
## VLADIMIR:
Chto eto znachit?
---
## HENCHMAN:
What?
---
## VLADIMIR:
What is the meaning of this?
---
## HENCHMAN:
We had one more person just show up.
---
The German.

## MIKE:
There you are.
---
I haven’t seen hide nor hair of you
---
or Tommy in the last couple of days.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Neither Tommy 
nor Sam have been back yet?
---
## MIKE:
No, but I got a call
from both of them.
---
Sam, he says he’s stuck 
watching some sanitorium.
---
Say’s he’s waiting for a Yellow broad
---
to show herself again.
---
## TUPPENCE:
That makes sense.
---
What did Tommy say?
---
## MIKE:
It wasn’t Tommy, actually.
---
Some cob Tommy had to call.
---
Fella said Tommy asked him 
to give you a message.
---
Let’s see.
---
Tell Tuppence I’m following the suspect
---
but I may be gone awhile.
---
## TUPPENCE:
That’s it?
---
Nothing more?
---
And it wasn’t Tommy himself?
---
## MIKE:
No.
---
## TUPPENCE:
That’s odd, 
but Tommy usually knows what he’s doing.
---
## MIKE:
Some street urchin came by
with a message:
---
“Tuppence is as good as a pound”?
---
Make sense to you?
---
## TUPPENCE:
Blast, sooner than I expected.
---
I need to make a call, Mike.
---
Mayfair 5478.
---
Mister Carter?
---
It’s Tuppence Crowley.
---
Can you arrange
for a false set of references for me?
---
Nothing too complicated.
---
A lady’s maid.

## TUPPENCE:
I’m Prudence Cooper.

I’m here for the position.
---
The agency sent me.
---
## RITA:
That was quick.
---
I just called them a little while ago.
---
## TUPPENCE:
I just happened to be 
in the office
---
when the call come in.
---
I begged them to send me out.
---
I ain’t had no position for weeks, ma’am.
---
I used to work for a high-class lady.
---
You can check my recommendation.
---
Ms. Dufferin, the Parsonage Llanelly.
---
## RITA:
And where in heaven’s name is that?
---
## TUPPENCE:
Wales, ma’am.
---
## RITA:
I see.
---
I suppose you thought 
you could get more money
---
by coming back to London?
---
It doesn’t matter to me.
---
I need someone and I need her now.
---
I can offer you a half-crown a week
if you can start right away.
---
## TUPPENCE:
I can.
---
I don’t have my things with me.
---
Would you like me to fetch them
from your rooms?
---
## RITA:
Do that later.
---
There’s an apron and cap in the kitchen.
---
I’m expecting company 
and I need someone right away.

## TUPPENCE:
Yes ma’am.

## ST. JOHN:
I’m here to see Mrs. Vandermeyer.
---
She’s expecting me.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Who shall I say is calling?
---
## ST. JOHN:
“Whom”.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Beg pardon?
---
## ST. JOHN:
It’s *whom*.
---
*Whom* shall I say is calling?
---
## TUPPENCE:
If you don’t know,
I’m afraid I can’t help you.
---
## ST. JOHN:
I like you.
---
Tell Mrs. Vandermeyer that
Lord St. John Peel-Edgerton has arrived.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Aren’t we fancy.
---
Wait a tic, 
ain’t you the fella who’s working
---
to stop the general strike?
---
## ST. JOHN:
One of them.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Oh, Lord love a duck.
---
I’m pleased to meet you.
---
My uncle went out in ’26 
at the Tonypandy mines,
---
and he ain’t worked a day since.
---
Another strike like that one 
it’ll kill the whole nation.
---
## ST. JOHN:
I agree wholeheartedly.
---
Which is why I’m working 
so hard to prevent the strike
---
and get fellows
like your uncle back to work.
---
Now run along.
---
## RITA:
Oh, St. John, how good of you 
to come and meet me.
---
Prudence, you may leave us now.
---
Where have you been?
---
I’ve been going mad waiting 
to see you again.
---
## ST. JOHN:
I’m so sorry, my dear,
---
but you know how busy I am.
---
There’s been so much for me
to look into lately.
---
There are even rumors
of Russian involvement
---
in the strike that the trade unions 
keep threatening.
---
You know how the government 
counts on me
---
to help keep them informed.
---
## RITA:
I thought you were
the friend of the working class.
---
I know your vaunted eloquence 
has saved many a man from the gallows.
---
What are you doing working
for the government?
---
## ST. JOHN:
Why must everyone assume 
that the world be looked at
---
in terms of the government 
versus the workers?
---
Is it truly not possible 
for there to be,
---
if not harmony, at least
a rapprochement between the two?
---
That is why I’m taking council 
with the strike leaders,
---
to see if we can find a way
to get the government
---
to give in to the trade unions’ demands,
---
without the necessity of a strike.
---
## RITA:
If you believe that,
---
you are more naïve than I thought.
---
## ST. JOHN:
Or perhaps more idealistic?
---
Whatever your plans are, Rita,
---
I’m not sure you should be counting on me
---
as much as you think you can.
---
## RITA:
Prudence.
---
Bring Lord Peel-Edgerton his hat and stick.
---
He’ll be leaving now.
---
Have a good day, Lord Peel-Edgerton.
---
## ST. JOHN:
You seem like a nice girl.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Thank you, Lord Peel-Edgerton.
---
## ST. JOHN:
I would hate to see you get
---
into trouble for bad habits.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Bad habits, sir?

*Whom* shall you say.

You English can’t even master
your own language.

Tell her it’s Number Two.

## TUPPENCE:
If you say so, sir.

## RITA:
You fool.
---
You shouldn’t be here.
---
## VLADIMIR:
I had to come!
---
Something has happened.
---
## RITA:
Prudence, you may go now.
---
You idiot.
---
You could have ruined everything.
---
## VLADIMIR:
Forget
to whom you’re speaking, woman.
---
I’m not a child and I’m not idiot.
---
Yellow is not here
and I have news to tell.
---
I need you to help me make contact.
---
## RITA:
Why?
What’s happened?
---
## VLADIMIR:
We caught a spy in our midst
---
at the meeting a few days ago.
---
He heard too much
before we caught him,
---
but we don’t know how he knows.
---
George hit them too hard 
and he keeps going into
---
and out of consciousness.
---
I don’t think we should kill him
without questioning him.
---
They wanted to leave that to Yellow.
---
## RITA:
Why not wait 
until Yellow contacts you,
---
as we’ve been instructed.
---
## VLADIMIR:
There is no time.
---
The strike is set to begin in a few days,
---
we must not let anything stop that.

Yes, that’s exactly what I told the fool

but he’s had something happen.

Oh, I see, you already know.
---
Are you sure?
---
No, no problem at all.
---
## VLADIMIR:
Was that Yellow?
---
## RITA:
Yes.
---
Yellow already knows what happened
---
and has already made plans 
to deal with it.
---
## VLADIMIR:
What?
---
How?
---
## RITA:
I wasn’t privy to that information.
---
I was just told to tell you to wait.
---
Prudence.
---
## PRUDENCE:
Yes, ma’am.
---
## RITA:
Prudence, I’m going to give you
the rest of the day off.
---
Please enjoy an afternoon at the cinema
---
and a choc ice on me.
---
## PRUDENCE:
If you’re sure, ma’am.
---
I wouldn’t like to leave you
in a lurch.
---
## RITA:
Not at all, I’ll be fine.
---
Just go now.
---
Now, I’m afraid I must be off as well.
---
Yellow said you two were 
to have a private conference.
---
## VLADIMIR:
Here or?
---
---
It’s so rare I have a moment to myself.
---
It’s nice.

## MIKE:
Oh, there you are.

I was about to send out 
the bloodhounds for you.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Why?
What has happened?
---
## MIKE:
A telegram came for you from Tommy.
---
## TUPPENCE:
“Twopence, I am alright.
---
Had a spot of trouble, but got out of it.
---
Sorry to worry you, old girl.
---
Everything is tip-top.
---
Come meet me at Rita’s, and I’ll explain.
---
Hurry. Thomas.”
Oh, Tommy.
---
I’m going to have 
to get you out of trouble again.
---
## MIKE:
What kind of trouble is he in?
---
## TUPPENCE:
According to this message, none at all.
---
## MIKE:
Then how can you get him out of it?
---
## TUPPENCE:
Because the telegram is a fake.
---
## MIKE:
How can you tell?
---
## TUPPENCE:
My name is spelled wrong.
---
It’s spelled like the actual coin
with a T-W-O at the start.
---
I’ve never spelled it like that.
---
I spell it like we say it, “Tuppence”.
---
He said he was all right 
but wrote it as one word.
---
## MIKE:
So?
---
## TUPPENCE:
Oh, dear.
---
Tommy and I had the same tutor growing up.
---
Such lackadaisical spelling 
would have earned us
---
a severe punishment 
and signing it “Thomas”?
---
Pish.
---
He’s never been a Thomas 
in his entire life.
---
No, this cannot have been written by Tommy,
---
which means I have to go.
---
## MIKE:
Why?
---
You said it was a trap.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Well, it is,
---
but springing it’s the only way
---
to find out what’s happened to Tommy.
---
Oh, Tommy, if you’ve gone 
and gotten yourself murdered,
---
I’ll kill you!
---

## RITA:
I’m sorry I cannot help you,
Lord Peel-Edgerton.
---
## ST. JOHN:
Well, I just thought I’d ask.
---
After all, a woman 
of your virtues tends
---
to pick up all kinds of information.
---
Mind, if you do hear anything 
about this missing treaty,
---
I trust you’ll let me know?
---
## RITA:
For a price, 
you can be certain of it.

I’m afraid that I’m not, though, darling.
---
So be a good girl 
and come along peaceful like.
---
## TUPPENCE:
I don’t suppose 
we could discuss this a bit?
---
## IRISHMAN:
Sure.
---
What can you do?
---
You might be a grand girl,
---
but I’m still sure Yellow will be wanting
---
to have a word with you as well
---
as the fellow we caught earwigging
---
at our meeting a few days ago.
---
Before we go, though,
---
would you mind handing
over any weapons you might have?
---
## TUPPENCE:
I’m sorry.
---
What weapons do you suppose
a lady might be carrying?
---
## IRISHMAN:
Give it a lash, will you,
---
and pull the other one.
---
[laughs]
I’ll just be relieving you
---
of any weapons you may have there
---
in your handbag if you’d be so kind.
---
[chuckles] Well, 
that wasn’t so hard now, was it?
---
Now, if you’d be so kind,
how about you go along down
---
that road a bit
---
and you’ll find everything 
you’ve been looking for.

## TUPPENCE:
Sappho’s poems?
---
The Gospel of Eve?
---
Peace, love, and understanding?

## IRISHMAN:
You must be one
---
of those damned women with a personality.
---
[laughs] That’s one thing
I never look for in a woman.
---
## TUPPENCE:
I’ll venture a guess,
---
there are a number of things
---
you’ve never looked for in a woman.

Tell you what, old girl.
---
You untie me first
---
and then we can talk it over, all right?
---
## TUPPENCE:
All right?
---
How many words is that?
---
## TOMMY:
What?
---
## TUPPENCE:
How many words is “all right”?
---
## TOMMY:
Two words.
---
What on earth are you asking for?
---
## TUPPENCE:
Just making sure you’re really you.
---
By the way, Ms. Birdwhistle
would be proud of both of us
---
for remembering our lessons.
---
Are you really all right, Tommy?
---
## TOMMY:
Well, 
I actually wasn’t treated too badly.
---
Although, I can’t honestly say 
I recommend this establishment.
---
The bed creaks, 
the telephone doesn’t work,
---
the room service is non-existent, 
and the staff are extremely rude.
---
## TUPPENCE:
You’ve no idea 
how worried I’ve been about you.
---
## TOMMY:
You really do care.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Of course, I do.
---
Mr. Carter wouldn’t give nearly 
as much for expenses
---
if I were the only one on the payrolls.
---
## TOMMY:
[laughs]
---
## TUPPENCE:
It wasn’t that funny.
---
## TOMMY:
No, my wrists are ticklish.
---
## TUPPENCE:
I had no idea.
---
## TOMMY:
If you scratch me 
behind my left ear,
---
my leg will shake.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Really, Tommy,
---
you’ve been spending too much time 
with that American.
---
---
template: music

## SAM:
[laughs] No, Mike, 
we detectives don’t make much.
---
In fact, I’m pretty much broke.
---
I’ve spent all my money 
on women and booze.
---
The rest I’ve spent foolishly.
---
## SAM:
Well, where have you two been?
---
Mike here had me worried with stories
---
of Tuppence going off 
to spring a… Are you okay?
---
## TUPPENCE:
We had the most delightful time.
---
Two men tried to kill Tommy,
---
but I was able to save him again.
---
## SAM:
Did you catch
the big cheese in the trap?
---
## TUPPENCE:
Just another little mouse, I fear.
---
## TOMMY:
I hope you’re referring
---
to the other fellow and not me.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Well, yes.
---
I suppose it was actually a little Irish rat.
---
## SAM:
What happened to him?
---
## TOMMY:
When she came
into the room where I was being held,
---
Tuppence got the drop on him,
as you Americans say.
---
I’m afraid she had to shoot him
in the vestibule.
---
## SAM:
Now, is *that* anywhere near the heart?
---
## TUPPENCE:
Is there anything 
you can’t make a joke out of, Sam?
---
## SAM:
Now while I’m alive, 
the people who try to kill me aren’t.
---
Mike, Mike, get us a couple of drinks.
---
These two look like 
they could use one and I could use two.
---
I feel like I’m missing something.
---
For what you told me,
that guy wasn’t Grand Poobah.
---
Even the Russian 
was just a cup of coffee crook.
---
## TUPPENCE:
You haven’t told us 
what kept you away all this while.
---
## SAM:
Geese.
---
## TOMMY:
I beg your pardon?
---
## TUPPENCE:
Wild ones, I’m guessing?
---
## SAM:
Yes, you’ve got it.
---
Now, I followed that yellow dame up
---
into some sanatorium out
in the sticks,
---
someplace called “Cran-ham” 
all the way out in “Glow-chester-shire”.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Cranham in Gloucestershire.
---
It’s like the sauce, Worcestershire.
---
## SAM:
One of these days y’all are going
---
to teach me the rules
of pronunciation around here.
---
## TOMMY:
Well, our rules for English
---
are the same as yours for killing:
whatever works.
---
## SAM:
Yes, I got it.
---
Anyway, once I got to that sanatorium,
---
that yellow dame just disappeared.
---
Now, I found myself having
to hang around that sanatorium for days,
---
mostly trying to find a way in.
---
I mean the place 
was crawling with guards.
---
Finally, I see this one nurse, 
cute little number,
---
oh, walking her dog.
---
Now, the little guy gets loose 
and I catch him.
---
The little guy is crazy about me,
---
so she lets me take her 
and her pooch for drinks
---
at the local island.
---
Clearly, she’s got good taste.
---
## TOMMY:
In men or dogs?
---
## SAM:
Is there a difference?
---
Anyways, 
now one thing led to another,
---
and after a couple of drinks,
---
I get her talking about the hospital.
---
Specifically, one patient that no one else
but a Dr. Chumley could see.
---
No one else had even seen the patient.
---
Her name was R. Bottom.
---
## TOMMY:
You found her.
---
## SAM:
No.
---
Now, the next night 
my new little friend snuck me
---
in around midnight.
---
Bye-bye.
---
Now, I picked the lock to Ms. Bottom’s door 
and it’s totally empty.
---
Everything was covered in dust.
---
No sign that anybody 
had been there in months,
---
not even the doctor who was
supposed to have been treating me.
---
That’s when I realized I’d been set up.
---
Unfortunately for the guy
that was waiting for me,
---
he didn’t expect me to go low.
---
Now, the first shot went high.
---

## TOMMY:
You mean you ran?
---
## SAM:
Hey, my noodle was safe,
---
and I’m chicken enough
to know that my noodle
---
and I could make a good soup.
---
Unfortunately, for the other guy,
---
I was only chicken enough
to run around back to the front.
---
Now, when he came out I told him to,
---
“Raise your hands.”
---
He only raised one, 
the one with the gun, so I shot him.
---
template: noise
gunshot
---
## SAM:
Dead before he hit the ground.
---
I’m sure only his mama 
would miss him.
---
Hey, maybe not even her.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Is your cynicism always this strong?
---
## SAM:
I have to keep exercising it.
---
## TOMMY:
Seriously, 
does killing get to you sometimes?
---
## SAM:
It’s all mind over matter.
---
If you don’t mind, it don’t matter.
---
## TOMMY:
That’s what
I kept saying during the war.
---
## SAM:
Keep saying it, Tommy.
---
Someday we might all believe it.
---
Mike, what’s keeping you
with those drinks?
---
## MIKE:
Coming right up, my lady.
---
Four special martinis,
---
and this time I know 
as I’ve got them right.
---
## TOMMY:
How so?
---
## MIKE:
Well, some lady stopped by 
and told me the secret.
---
Ooh, she gave me 
a special bottle of vermouth too.
---
Oh, I wasn’t supposed to tell you
---
that till after you’ve tried it.
---
## TUPPENCE:
What lady?
---
What did she look like?
---
## MIKE:
Hard to describe.
---
Blonde with the biggest yellow scarf
you’ve ever seen.
---
## TOMMY and TUPPENCE:
Ms. Yellow!
---
## TUPPENCE:
Sam, we’ve got to get you to the hospital.
---
Mike, phone for an ambulance.
---
## TOMMY:
Stay with us, Sam.
---
Sam.
---
Sam, are you all right?
---
## SAM:
Are you kidding me?
---
I ain’t had this much fun 
since the hog ate my kid sister.

## TUPPENCE:
Remind me what we’re doing
---
all the way out here in Gloucestershire?
---
## TOMMY:
Searching for clues 
as to what Ms. Yellow is up to.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Which clues might those be?
---
## TOMMY:
I have no idea,
but every crumb means something
---
to a hungry badger,
---
and this flat where the nurse lives
---
is the only place I can think of to go.
---
She might have some information.
---
That attack on Sam 
has to be because
---
of what he was doing here.
---
He must have gotten
too close to Ms. Yellow.
---
## TUPPENCE:
How do you know
we weren’t the intended targets?
---
## TOMMY:
Well, I’m sure 
she wouldn’t have minded,
---
but that poison was clearly meant 
for Sam and his martinis.
---
template: noise

---
Thank God we got him 
to the hospital in time.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Thank God for Sam’s ulcers.
---
## TOMMY:
Yes, I guess.
---
Although I’m still not quite sure
I understood all that.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Sam had
Mike pouring him glasses
---
of milk on the side 
to calm down his ulcers.
---
Nice, rich, Lake Country milk.
---
The doctor said that 
the milk coated his stomach lining
---
just enough to keep the strychnine 
from becoming fatal.
---
Maybe that will get him 
to slow down on the martinis a bit.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Or not.
---
template: noise
knock
---
## TUPPENCE:
That’s odd.
---
The hospital said 
she called in sick today.
---
## TOMMY:
My turn.
---
## TUPPENCE:
I’ve got a funny feeling
about this, Tommy.
---
## TOMMY:
Well, if there’s any danger,
---
you can just hide behind me
and my fashionable profile.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Fashionable?
---
You’ve been wearing
the same suit for three days.
---
## TOMMY:
I’m British.
---
What do you expect?
---
Now, let’s see what we find.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Whatever we find here,
---
I want to go back to London
---
and see if we can find that Frenchman.
---
He’s the last member of the Secret Council
---
and I don’t feel safe knowing
he’s still out there.
---
---
## TOMMY:
Oh, actually, old girl,
---
I think we have found the Frenchman.
---
He’s here along 
with that nurse, apparently.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Oh, poor woman.
---
We should have known she didn’t have
---
a tuppence of a chance 
when she talked to Sam.
---
## TOMMY:
Let’s get out of here.
---
I don’t fancy having to explain all this
---
to the Gloucestershire constabulary.
---
Wait a tick.
---
There’s something in the basket.
---
Znak strakhu.
---
## TUPPENCE:
The sign of fear.
---
## TOMMY:
I think it’s time 
to give Carter another call.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Indeed.
---
He’s going to have 
to set up a meeting between me
---
and Lord Peel-Edgerton at Rita’s place.
---
## TOMMY:
At Rita’s place?
---
Are you mad?
---
That’s simply too dangerous.
---
I won’t allow you to do it.
---
## TUPPENCE:
I beg your pardon, 
Lord Thomas of Beresford.
---
I wasn’t aware I needed 
my lord’s permission
---
to do anything.
---
## TOMMY:
Blast it all, Tuppence.
---
That’s not what I mean.
---
It’s just I can’t risk it.
---
## TUPPENCE:
That’s just it, Tommy, 
you won’t be risking it.
---
I will, and yes, it has to be me.
---
I’m the only one 
who can lull Lord Peel-Egerton
---
into complacency.
---
After all, I’m just a woman.
---
## TOMMY:
Does anyone ever tell you no?
---
## TUPPENCE:
Certainly not twice.
---
template: music
---
## TUPPENCE:
It’s over here.
---
## TOMMY:
You’re certain 
that Mrs. Vandermeyer won’t be here?
---
## TUPPENCE:
Positive.
---
## RITA:
No need for the positive.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Are you sure?
---
## RITA:
I’m positive.
---
Sit.
---
You’ve been conspiring
behind my back, haven’t you?
---
## TUPPENCE:
Where else would one conspire?
---
## RITA:
[chuckles] 
I must say I was disappointed
---
when you disappeared on me.
---
You were not only one
of the best maids I ever had,
---
I truly enjoyed your company 
as I enjoyed yours, St. John.
---
Now I discover the two 
of you were simply using me,
---
it appears, 
while enjoying your own tête-à-tête.
---
How disappointing.
---
I suppose one must learn
to live with disappointments
---
in this world.
---
Now, suppose you tell me 
what you two have been up to?
---
## TUPPENCE:
Lord Peel-Edgerton 
was just explaining
---
to me how there were no bathtubs 
in the United States
---
until President Fillmore 
put one in the White House.
---
## RITA:
I see.
---
It appears you don’t want 
to make this easy.
---
That is not simply fine
with me, it is preferable.
---
I like playing it rough.
---
## ST. JOHN:
[groans]
---
## RITA:
Let’s start with a little rope work.
---
Tie up Lord Peel-Edgerton.
---
Once that’s done, 
I can take care of you.
---
I suppose you thought
you were being clever
---
with your little disguise, didn’t you?
---
A maid?
---
Really?
---
Trust me when I tell you
that your performance
---
was far too perfect.
---
Not really enough disdain 
for the upper class hidden
---
under your words, I fear.
---
You are far too attentive
to the comings and goings.
---
Now for Ms. Prudence.
---
If that is your real name.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Oh, it is.
---
Prudence Crowley.
---
My friends call me Tuppence.
---
You can call me Ms. Crowley.
---
[groans] Sam, look out.
---
template: noise

## TUPPENCE:
Don’t move.
---
## TOMMY:
Tuppence, are you all right?
---
## TUPPENCE:
I’m fine, but I’m afraid Sam
---
is going to need another trip
to the hospital.
---
## SAM:
That dame Tuppence 
got the drop on needs a trip
---
to the hoosegow.
---
Tommy, I think you need
to untie that guy.
---
I would, but my flipper got winged.
---
## ST. JOHN:
Thank you, my good man.
---
[grunts]
Terribly sorry about your injury.
---
You must be that American chap
---
that Tuppence told me about.
---
## SAM:
You must be that “Lord Saint John” fellow who’s doing that strike thing.
---
## ST. JOHN:
It is.
---
Although it’s actually pronounced--
Never mind.
---
Thank you all the same.
---
## CARTER:
Mr. Beresford,
---
you take Mr. Charles to the hospital
---
while I take Mrs. Vandermeyer to the--
---
What was that word you used?
---
Oh, Hoosegow.
---
I like it.
---
Hoosegow.
---
…Hoosegow.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Well, we may not have been able
---
to catch the rest of the conspirators,
---
but at least we’ve caught 
the mastermind behind the Secret Council.
---
It’s just too bad we weren’t able
---
to find that document we were after.
---
## ST. JOHN:
A tragedy, indeed.
---
However, having Mrs. Vandermeyer
in custody is almost as good
---
and will go a long way towards
---
stopping the threat of the general strike.
---
## TUPPENCE:
why is that, pray tell?
---
## ST. JOHN:
Well, it should be obvious
---
by now that Rita 
has been Ms. Yellow all along.
---
## TUPPENCE:
I don’t think so.
---
## ST. JOHN:
We already knew
---
that she was in contact 
with the rest of the Secret Council.
---
You have found
the leader and Great Britain
---
is once again safe.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Indeed, I think we have
---
and indeed I think it is, 
but Rita is not the leader.
---
## ST. JOHN:
Oh, don’t be absurd.
---
You yourself were in these very rooms
---
when members of
the Secret Council mentioned Ms. Yellow.
---
You saw Ms. Yellow
---
when you were at the Esthonia Glass Works, 
did you not?
---
## TUPPENCE:
I saw the leader indeed,
---
but it wasn’t Ms. Yellow.
---
It’s interesting that everyone 
could describe the leader
---
with all that blonde hair,
---
those big glasses, 
and a monstrous yellow scarf.
---
Of course, yellow draws
the attention away
---
from everything else.
---
Well, the scarf hides much of the face
---
and it also hides the neck,
---
which means it hides an Adam’s apple.
---
It was you all along, wasn’t it,
*Mr.* Yellow?
---
## ST. JOHN:
I beg your pardon?
---
## TUPPENCE:
Yes, it was all a clever ruse, 
Lord St. John Peel-Edgerton.
---
## ST. JOHN:
That is indeed my name.
---
## TUPPENCE:
It’s also the final clue
that helped me tumble to you.
---
Your first name, St. John [“Sin-jin”].
---
During the war, the French
would’ve pronounced it “Saine Zhon”.
---
## ST. JOHN:
I’m afraid I don’t follow.
---
## TUPPENCE:
St. John, 
which sounds like the French word Jaune,
---
which is French for yellow.
---
Thus to them, St. John sounds 
like “Saint Yellow” 
---
and so that’s the nickname they gave you,
---
and you remembered 
that when you came home from the war
---
and began your new plans.
---
## ST. JOHN:
Well, this is all very interesting
---
and unfortunate.
---
Do stand still.
---
This is all so very distressing.
---
I liked you so much,
---
and I’m going to regret having
to take care of you.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Not half as much 
as I’m going to regret it.
---
There’s just one thing
I haven’t figured out.
---
Why?
---
## ST. JOHN:
Why?
---
## TUPPENCE:
Why did you do all of this?
---
Why set up the Secret Council?
---
Why try and push the trades unions
---
into a general strike?
---
Why, when you almost had it all,
---
did you kill off the Secret Council
---
and help prevent the strike?
---
## ST. JOHN:
Quite simple.
---
I’ve now made it clear 
to the entire nation
---
how irrational the trades unionists are.
---
It will take them years
to recover their reputation,
---
and now they’ll have
to give up all that nonsense.
---
## TUPPENCE:
That nonsense 
about decent wages,
---
a five-day workweek, 
proper safety, no child labor?
---
## ST. JOHN:
Precisely.
---
What businessman could possibly afford
---
to put up with all that rot?
---
The next thing you know,
---
they’ll be wanting free health care 
or such silliness.
---
Now that their secret support is gone,
---
they’ll be left high and dry.
---
I’ll offer them a way out 
and the whole nation
---
will see that I’m the only one
---
who can actually negotiate rationally.
---
I’ll be Prime Minister
before the year is out.
---
I’ll have to kill all those fools
---
on that factious Secret Council
that you call.
---
They have outlived the instruments
---
and I couldn’t have them staring 
enough further troubled in my nice,
---
peaceful, well-controlled nation now, 
could I?
---
## TUPPENCE:
Wouldn’t it just be easier
---
to take good care of the workers?
---
## ST. JOHN:
You are so naïve.
---
Now I’m afraid it’s the time for you
---
and I to take a little trip.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Really?
---
Where would we travel to?
---
## ST. JOHN:
Somewhere 
where I can conveniently dispose
---
of your body.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Why on earth 
would I leave this room with you?
---
## ST. JOHN:
Because I’ll shoot
you right here if you don’t.
---
## TUPPENCE:
You’ll shoot me 
somewhere else if I do.
---
I don’t see that as being much 
of an advantage to me.
---
## ST. JOHN:
Have it your way.
---
I’m sure I can find some way
to explain this all away.
---
After all, I’m a British Lord,
---
and British Lords 
just don’t do such things,
---
and even if we do, 
we can only be tried
---
by our own peers in the House of Lords.
---
They will never convict me
---
without some pretty strong evidence.

## TUPPENCE:
Oh my, did Rita load

that pistol with blanks?

How horribly careless of her.

I think you can come
in any time now, Tommy.
---
## RITA:
Lord St. John Peel-Edgerton, I arrest you
---
in the name of the King.
---
Please note that anything you say
---
can be used against you at trial.
---
## ST. JOHN:
You can’t arrest me.
---
## RITA:
Oh, I assure you we can.
---
You’re guilty.
---
We all heard your confession thanks
---
to the microphone hidden in the wall.
---
## ST. JOHN:
No, I mean you can’t arrest me.
---
You’re in on the plot.
---
## CARTER:
Oh, I’m terribly sorry,
---
I need to complete the introductions.
---
Lord Peel-Edgerton, 
allow me to introduce you
---
to Chief Inspector Constance Tally
of Scotland Yard.
---
I assure you 
she has the authority to arrest you.
---
## RITA:
I can assure you that the House of Lords
---
will have no trouble convicting you,
---
contrary to what you told Ms. Crowley.
---
There’s a car waiting outside 
to take you away.
---
Just come quietly, please.
---
## ST. JOHN:
You were shot.
---
I saw you get hit.
---
## SAM:
Got me.
---
Right in the sternum.
---
## TOMMY, TUPPENCE, AND SAM:
*That’s* the one just below the heart!
---
## CARTER:
Well done, Ms. Crowley.
---
## TOMMY:
Well done, indeed, Tuppence,
---
although I am still upset
---
that we let you be the one
---
to spring the trap
---
even though the pistol only had blanks,
---
you were still in danger.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Oh, Tommy,
---
I wasn’t in a tuppence-worth of danger.
---
Lord Peel-Edgerton
---
would never have risked an actual fight.
---
He was too much of a coward.
---
Thanks to Sam’s acting,
---
Lord Peel-Edgerton
was convinced that the gun was,
---
indeed, fully loaded.
---
## SAM:
I still don’t know 
what made you tumble to him.
---
## TUPPENCE:
He was simply 
too good to be true.
---
He seemed to have all the answers.
---
He was always in the middle of everything
---
and yet no one could quite explain why, 
so I asked Mr. Carter
---
to do some background on him for me.
---
## CARTER:
Well, I had my suspicions,
---
so I looked up his old army records
---
and discovered he wasn’t 
the war hero everyone led him to be.
---
He was actually a bit of a cad,
---
always avoiding the trenches, you see,
---
a total bounder,
---
letting all
the other fellows take the risks.
---
I followed up 
with my opposite number
---
in the French government and they told me
---
no one on their side 
of the channel trusted him a whit.
---
Told me their nickname
for him, in fact.
---
## TOMMY:
Nickname?
---
## TUPPENCE:
St. Jaune.
St. Yellow.
---
The color of cowardice.
---
They weren’t simply making 
a pun on his name,
---
they were noting 
that he was that rare British officer
---
who never took a risk,
---
and the only reason
he was willing
---
to negotiate with the trades unions
---
was that he knew he could end the fight
---
any time he chose and be the hero.
---
## CARTER:
I’m still a bit baffled
---
on how you tumbled to the fact
---
that Rita was one of my agents, though.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Oh, that became clear 
once we thought about it.
---
It was clear you
weren’t being honest with us.
---
## CARTER:
Are you suggesting
I wasn’t telling the truth?
---
## TOMMY:
Telling the truth
and being honest
---
aren’t quite the same thing, sir.
---
One of those truths you told us 
was incomplete.
---
## CARTER:
That was?
---
## TUPPENCE:
You said you couldn’t find Rita.
---
Really, sir, if Tommy, Sam,
---
and I could find Rita in a matter of days,
---
it wouldn’t have been saying much
---
for the service
if you hadn’t been able to.
---
The only reason you couldn’t find her
---
was you weren’t really looking for her.
---
## TOMMY:
I’m guessing that the information
---
that was spread about 
Rita and Rosey Bottoms
---
was actually done by you as a means
---
of muddying the waters 
for the Secret Council?
---
## CARTER:
Well, we’ll let 
your conjectures stand for the moment.
---
Right now, I simply want to thank all 
of you on behalf of the service.
---
You’ve done an excellent job.
---
I’m just sorry the treaty
was never found.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Of course, it wasn’t.
---
## CARTER:
Why do you say that?
---
## TOMMY:
Because it was never lost.
---
## CARTER:
Come now, 
what were you two nattering on about?
---
## TUPPENCE:
You didn’t care a tuppenny dip
---
about the treaty because the government
---
had found it and destroyed it
in 1915.
---
## CARTER:
Oh, I beg to differ, Ms. Crowley.
---
It’s been missing this entire time
along with Ms. Rosey Bottoms.
---
I told you Ms. Bottoms was injured 
in the aftermath of the disaster,
---
suffering from amnesia, 
not knowing who she was
---
or what she had done 
with the oilskin packet.
---
It wasn’t until last year 
that her memory returned,
---
but after calling my office 
with the story,
---
and following up with claims 
that corroborated everything,
---
she simply disappeared with the treaty.
---
We’ve been searching for her ever since.
---
## TOMMY:
Oh, come now.
---
Amnesia?
---
Really?
---
Doesn’t that strike you
---
as just a touch convenient, Tuppence?
---
## TUPPENCE:
Oh, indeed, Tommy.
---
Only someone potty enough 
to be a Bolshevik
---
would believe that old amnesia tripe.
---
## TOMMY:
It was enough 
to fool Lord Peel-Edgerton
---
and the Bolsheviks.
---
That’s why Whittington 
wanted you to go to Paris.
---
He wanted to find Rosey Bottoms to see
---
if he could cure her of her amnesia
---
and get a copy of the treaty.
---
## SAM:
Good thing that 
was never going to happen.
---
That would have been bad
for your country and mine.
---
Good thing it was just a lark.
---
## CARTER:
Oh, what on earth 
are you talking about?
---
That treaty would have been 
pure gold in the wrong hands.
---
## TOMMY:
Absolutely.
---
## TUPPENCE:
The interesting thing about gold
---
is that it’s most comforting
when it’s unimportant,
---
and it was unimportant to you
---
because it was only the idea
---
of the treaty’s existence
that mattered.
---
## SAM:
I think what really happened
---
was Ms. Bottoms’ body 
was found in the aftermath
---
of the disaster along 
with the oilskin packet,
---
and the treaty
was destroyed long ago.
---
## CARTER:
Oh, that’s what I get
for hiring the two of you
---
and letting this American
into the country in the first place.
---
Oh, yes, Mr. Charles,
---
we’ve had our eyes 
on you since the moment you docked.
---
You really are all too clever 
for your own good,
---
or at least for mine.
---
You almost got it right.
---
Ms. Bottoms 
was indeed found, but she was not dead.
---
She was, and still is,
alive and living here in England.
---
She met and married
a wonderful chap
---
and was able to change 
that dreadful name.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Married?
---
Really?
---
## CARTER:
Yes, to the captain of the ship
---
that rescued her after
the Lusitania went down.
---
James Cheeks.
---
She’s no longer Ms. Rosey Bottoms.
---
She’s Mrs. Rosey Cheeks.
---
A far better image, I’m sure you’ll agree.
---
## SAM:
You destroyed the treaty?
---
## CARTER:
Oh, no, we’d never destroy that.
---
That treaty guarantees
---
that you Americans will step up
---
and help us in any war against Germany.
---
It doesn’t say which war.
---
With everything happening 
in Germany nowadays,
---
you never know when such
a treaty will come in handy.
---
What truly matters is that we found
---
the traitor inside the government,
---
which was our goal in all of this.
---
## TOMMY:
It’s a good thing to know
we gave you value for your money.
---
## CARTER:
Because there are no refunds.
---
Meanwhile, since you’ve proven your worth,
---
I trust you will not spill the beans,
---
as you Americans like to say.
---
It’s all covered in the Official 
Secrets Act, you know.
---
## TOMMY:
You can trust us, sir.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Wouldn’t betray you
for tuppence.
---
## SAM:
I’m on the square.
---
These lips are zipped.
---
## CARTER:
Excellent.
---
Well, I think we can allow you 
to return home, Mr. Charles.
---
I think we may be able 
to find more employment
---
for Adventurers Limited.
---
I’ll see you two in my office tomorrow.
---
Stay in touch.
---
## SAM:
Well, I guess 
it’s back to San Francisco for me.
---
[laughs] Hey, keep an eye 
on this mug, would you?
---
## TOMMY:
I’ll keep an eye on Tuppence too, 
you can count on that.
---
## SAM:
[laughs] You can try.

## TOMMY:
Well, this has 
turned out rather nicely.
---
A regular job with the old man.
---
I think I can finally afford a proper flat.
---
## TUPPENCE:
You mean 
*we* can afford a proper flat.
---
## TOMMY:
We?
---
You mean us, as in together?
---
## TUPPENCE:
Yes.
---
I accept.
---
## TOMMY:
I’m sorry.
---
Accept what?
---
## TUPPENCE:
Your proposal.
---
## TOMMY:
I haven’t made one yet.
---
## TUPPENCE:
I’ve noticed 
and I’ve grown tired of waiting.
---
You have wanted to, haven’t you?
---
## TOMMY:
For ages.
---
## TUPPENCE:
Then let’s consider it done, 
shall we?
---
Or are you going to pass me up?
---
## TOMMY:
A man silly enough to pass up
---
a woman like you wouldn’t be 
worth tuppence.
